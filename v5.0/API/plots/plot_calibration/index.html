<p>Well calibrated classifiers are probabilistic classifiers for
which the output of the <code>predict_proba</code> method can be directly
interpreted as a confidence level. For instance a well
calibrated (binary) classifier should classify the samples such
that among the samples to which it gave a <code>predict_proba</code> value
close to 0.8, approx. 80% actually belong to the positive class.
Read more in sklearn's <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This figure shows two plots: the calibration curve, where the
x-axis represents the average predicted probability in each bin
and the y-axis is the fraction of positives, i.e. the proportion
of samples whose class is the positive class (in each bin); and
a distribution of all predicted probabilities of the classifier.
Only available for binary classification tasks.</p>
