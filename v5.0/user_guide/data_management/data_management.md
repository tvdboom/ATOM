# Data management
-----------------

## Data sets

ATOM is designed to work around one single dataset: the one with which
atom is initialized. This is the dataset you want to explore, transform,
and use for model training and validation. ATOM differentiates three
different data sets:

* The **training set** is usually the largest of the data sets. As the
  name suggests, this set is used to train the pipeline. During
  [hyperparameter tuning][], only the training set is used to fit and
  evaluate the estimator in every call. The training set in the current
  [branch][branches] can be accessed through the `train` attribute. It's
  features and target can be accessed through `X_train` and `y_train`
  respectively.
* The **test set** is used to evaluate the models. The model scores on
  this set give an indication on how the model performs on new data. The
  test set can be accessed through the `test` attribute. It's features
  and target can be accessed through `X_test` and `y_test` respectively.
* The **holdout set** is an optional, separate set that should only be
  used to evaluate the final model's performance. Create this set when
  you are going to use the test set for an intermediate validation step.
  The holdout set is immediately set apart during initialization and is
  not considered part of atom's dataset (the `dataset` attribute only
  returns the train and test sets). The holdout set is left untouched
  until predictions are made on it, i.e. it does not undergo any pipeline
  transformations. The holdout set is stored in atom's `holdout` attribute.
  It's features and target can not be accessed separately. See [here][example-holdout-set]
  an example that shows how to use the holdout data set.

The data can be provided in different formats. If the data sets are not
specified beforehand, you can input the features and target separately
or together:

* X
* X, y

Remember to use the `y` parameter to indicate the target column in X when
using the first option. If not specified, the last column in X is used as
target. In both these cases, the size of the sets are defined using the
`test_size` and `holdout_size` parameters. Note that the splits are made
after the subsample of the dataset with the `n_rows` parameter (when not
left to its default value).

If you already have the separate data sets, provide them using one of the
following formats:

* train, test
* train, test, holdout
* X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
* X_train, X_test, X_holdout, y_train, y_test, y_holdout
* (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test)
* (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test), (X_holdout, y_holdout)

The input data is always converted internally to a [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html),
if it isn't one already. The column names should always be strings. If
they are not, atom changes their type at initialization. If no column
names are provided, default names are given of the form `X[N-1]`,
where N stands for the n-th feature in the dataset.

## Indexing

By default, atom resets the dataframe's [index](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)
after initialization and after every transformation in the pipeline.
To avoid this, specify the `index` parameter. If the dataset has an
'identifier' column, it is useful to use it as index for two reasons:

* An identifier doesn't usually contain any useful information
  on the target column, and should therefore be removed before training.
* [Predictions][predicting] of specific rows can be accessed through
  their index.

!!! warning
    Avoid duplicate indices in the dataframe. Having them may potentially
    lead to unexpected behavior.

## Sparse datasets

If atom is initialized using a scipy sparse matrix, it is converted
internally to a dataframe of sparse columns. Read more about pandas'
sparse data structures [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/sparse.html).
The same conversion takes place when a transformer returns a sparse
matrix, like for example, the [Vectorizer][].

Note that ATOM considers a dataset to be sparse if any of the columns
is sparse. A dataset can only benefit from sparsity when all its
columns are sparse, hence mixing sparse and non-sparse columns is
not recommended and can cause estimators to decrease their training
speed or even crash. Use the [shrink][atomclassifier-shrink] method
to convert dense features to sparse and the [available_models]
[atomclassifier-available_models] method to check which models have
native support for sparse matrices.

## Branches

You might want to compare how a model performs on a dataset transformed
through multiple pipelines, each using different transformers. For
example, on one pipeline with an undersampling strategy and the other
with an oversampling strategy. To be able to do this, ATOM has the
branching system.

The branching system helps the user to manage multiple data pipelines
within the same atom instance. Branches are created and accessed
through atom's `branch` property. A branch contains a specific pipeline,
the dataset transformed through that pipeline, and all data and utility
attributes that refer to that dataset. Transformers and models called
from atom use the dataset in the current branch, as well as data
attributes such as `atom.dataset`. Use the branch's \__repr__ to get an
overview of the transformers in the branch. It's not allowed to change
the data in a branch after fitting a model with it. Doing this would
cause unexpected model behaviour and break down the plotting methods.
Instead, create a new branch for every unique pipeline.

By default, atom starts with one branch called "master". To start a new
branch, set a new name to the property, e.g. `#!python atom.branch = "undersample"`.
This creates a new branch from the current one. To create a branch from any
other branch type "\_from\_" between the new name and the branch from which
to split, e.g. `#!python atom.branch = "oversample_from_master"` creates
branch "oversample" from branch "master", even if the current branch is
"undersample". To switch between existing branches, just type the name of
the desired branch, e.g. `#!python atom.branch = "master"` brings you back
to the master branch. Note that every branch contains a unique copy of the
whole dataset! Creating many branches can cause memory issues for large datasets.

See the [Imbalanced datasets][example-imbalanced-datasets] or
[Feature engineering][example-feature-engineering] examples for
branching use cases.

!!! warning
    Always create a new branch if you want to change the dataset after fitting
    a model!

## Memory considerations

An atom instance stores one copy of the dataframe in each branch, and
one copy of the initial dataset with which the instance is initialized
(this copy is necessary to avoid data leakage during hyperparameter
tuning and for some specific methods like [cross_validate][adaboost-cross_validate]
and [reset][atomclassifier-reset]). This initial copy is created as soon
as there are no branches in the initial state (usually after calling the
first data transformation) and it's stored in an internal branch called
`og` (original). The og branch is not accessible by the user. If the
dataset is occupying too much memory, consider using the [shrink]
[atomclassifier-shrink] method to convert the dtypes to their smallest
possible matching dtype.

Apart from the dataset itself, a model's [prediction attributes][] (e.g.
`#!python atom.lr.predict_train`), metric scores and [shap values][shap]
are also stored as attributes of the model to avoid having to recalculate
them every time they are needed. This data can occupy a considerable amount
of memory for large datasets. You can delete all these attributes using
the [clear][atomclassifier-clear] method in order to free some memory
before [saving][atomclassifier-save] the class.

## Data transformations

Performing data transformations is a common requirement of many datasets
before they are ready to be ingested by a model. ATOM provides various
classes to apply [data cleaning][] and [feature engineering][]
transformations to the data. This tooling should be able to help you
apply most of the typically needed transformations to get the data ready
for modelling. For further fine-tuning, it's also possible to transform
the data using custom transformers (see the [add][atomclassifier-add]
method) or through a function (see the [apply][atomclassifier-apply]
method). Remember that all transformations are only applied to the
dataset in the current branch.
