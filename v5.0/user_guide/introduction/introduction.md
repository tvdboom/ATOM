# Introduction
--------------

There is no magic formula in data science that can tell us which type
of machine learning estimator in combination with which pipeline will
perform best for a given raw dataset. Different models are better
suited for different types of data and different types of problems. You
can follow some [rough guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html)
on how to approach problems with regard to which model to try, but
these are incomplete at best.

During the exploration phase of a machine learning project, a data
scientist tries to find the optimal pipeline for his specific use case.
This usually involves applying standard data cleaning steps, creating
or selecting useful features, trying out different models, etc. Testing
multiple pipelines requires many lines of code, and writing it all in
the same notebook often makes it long and cluttered. On the other hand,
using multiple notebooks makes it harder to compare the results and to
keep an overview. On top of that, refactoring the code for every test
can be quite time-consuming. How many times have you conducted the same
action to pre-process a raw dataset? How many times have you
copy-and-pasted code from an old repository to re-use it in a new use
case?

Although best practices tell us to start with a simple model and build
up to more complicated ones, many data scientists just use the model
best known to them in order to avoid the aforementioned problems. This
can result in poor performance (because the model is just not the
right one for the task) or in inefficient management of time and
computing resources (because a simpler/faster model could have achieved
a similar performance).

ATOM is here to help solve these common issues. The package acts as
a wrapper of the whole machine learning pipeline, helping the data
scientist to rapidly find a good model for his problem. Avoid
endless imports and documentation lookups. Avoid rewriting the same
code over and over again. With just a few lines of code, it's now
possible to perform basic data cleaning steps, select relevant
features and compare the performance of multiple models on a given
dataset, providing quick insights on which pipeline performs best
for the task at hand.

It is important to realize that ATOM is not here to replace all the
work a data scientist has to do before getting his model into
production. ATOM doesn't spit out production-ready models just by
tuning some parameters in its API. After helping you determine the
right pipeline, you will most probably need to fine-tune it using
use-case specific features and data cleaning steps in order to
achieve maximum performance.

Example steps taken by ATOM's pipeline:

1. Data Cleaning
	* Handle missing values
	* Encode categorical features
    * Detect and remove outliers
	* Balance the training set
2. Feature engineering
    * Create new non-linear features
	* Select the most promising features
3. Train and validate multiple models
	* Apply hyperparameter tuning
	* Fit the models on the training set
    * Evaluate the results on the test set
4. Analyze the results
    * Get the scores on various metrics
    * Make plots to compare the model performances
