# Automated Tool for Optimized Modelling
----------------------------------------


There is no magic formula in data science that can tell us which type of machine
 learning algorithm will perform best for a specific use-case. Different models
 are better suited for different types of data and different problems. At best,
 you can follow some [rough guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html)
 on how to approach problems with regard to which model to try on your data, but
 these are often more confusing than helpful. Best practices tell
 us to start with a simple model (e.g. linear regression) and build up to more
 complicated models (e.g. logistic regression -> random forest -> multilayer perceptron)
 if you are not satisfied with the results. Unfortunately, different models require
 different data cleaning steps, different type/amount of features, tuning a new set
 of hyperparameters, etc. Refactoring the code for this purpose can be quite boring
 and time consuming. Because of this, many data scientists end up just using the model
 best known to them and fine-tuning this particular model without ever trying different
 ones. This can result in poor performance (because the model is just not the right one
 for the task) or in poor time management (because you could have achieved a similar
 performance with a simpler/faster model).

ATOM is here to help us solve these issues. With just a few lines of code, you can
 perform basic data cleaning steps, select relevant features and compare the performance
 of multiple models on a given dataset. ATOM should be able to provide quick insights
 on which algorithms perform best for the task at hand and provide an indication of
 the feasibility of the ML solution.

It is important to realize that ATOM is not here to replace all the work a data
 scientist has to do before getting his model into production. ATOM doesn't spit out
 production-ready models just by tuning some parameters in its API. After helping you
 to determine the right model, you will most probably need to fine-tune it using
 use-case specific features and data cleaning steps in order to achieve maximum performance.

So, this sounds a bit like AutoML, how is ATOM different than 
 [auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) or [TPOT](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/)?
 Well, ATOM does AutoML in the sense that it helps you find the best model for a
 specific task, but contrary to the aforementioned packages, it does not actively
 search for the best model. It simply runs all of them and let you pick the one that
 you think suites you best. AutoML packages are often black boxes: if you provide
 data, it will magically return a working model. Although it works great, they often
 produce complicated pipelines with low explainability, hard to sell to the business.
 In this, ATOM excels. Every step of the pipeline is accounted for, and using the
 provided plotting methods, it’s easy to demonstrate why a model is better/worse than
 the other.

!!!note
    A data scientist with domain knowledge can outperform ATOM if he applies
    usecase-specific feature engineering or data cleaning steps! 


Example steps taken by ATOM's pipeline:

1. Data Cleaning
	* Handle missing values
	* Encode categorical features
    * Remove outliers
	* Balance the dataset
2. Feature engineering
    * Create new non-linear features
	* Remove multi-collinear features
	* Remove features with too low variance
	* Select the most promising features based on a statistical test
3. Train and validate multiple models
	* Select hyperparameters using a Bayesian Optimization approach
	* Train and test the models on the provided data
	* Perform bagging to assess the robustness of the output
4. Analyze the results
    * Get the model scores on various metrics
    * Make plots to compare the model performances
