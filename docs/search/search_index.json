If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to create a new discussion or post them on the Slack channel! </p> <p>??? faq Is this package related to the Atom text editor?\"     There is, indeed, a text editor with the same name and a similar logo as     this package. Is this a shameless copy? No. When I started the project,     I didn't know about the text editor, and it doesn't require much thinking     to come up with the idea of replacing the letter O of the word atom with     the image of an atom.</p> How does ATOM relate to AutoML? <p>ATOM is not an AutoML tool since it does not automate the search for an optimal pipeline like well known AutoML tools such as auto-sklearn or EvalML do. Instead, ATOM helps the user find the optimal pipeline himself. One of the goals of this package is to help data scientists produce explainable pipelines, and using an AutoML black box function would impede that. That said, it is possible to integrate a EvalML pipeline with atom through the automl method.</p> Is it possible to run deep learning models? <p>Yes. Deep learning models can be added as custom models to the pipeline as long as they follow sklearn's API. For more information, see the deep learning section of the user guide.</p> Can I run atom's methods on just a subset of the columns? <p>Yes, all data cleaning and feature engineering methods accept a <code>columns</code> parameter to only transform the selected features. For example, to only impute the numerical columns in the dataset we could type <code>atom.impute(strat_num=\"mean\", columns=atom.numerical)</code>. The parameter accepts column names, column indices, dtypes or a slice object.</p> How can I compare the same model on different datasets? <p>In many occasions you might want to test how a model performs on datasets processed with different pipelines. For this, atom has the branch system. Create a new branch for every new pipeline you want to test and use the plot methods to compare all models, independent of the branch it was trained on.</p> Can I train models through atom using a GPU? <p>Yes. Refer to the user guide to see what algorithms and models have a GPU implementation. Be aware that it requires additional software and hardware dependencies.</p> How are numerical and categorical columns differentiated? <p>The columns are separated using a dataframe's select_dtypes method. Numerical columns are selected using <code>include=\"number\"</code> whereas categorical columns are selected using <code>exclude=\"number\"</code>.</p> Can I run unsupervised learning pipelines? <p>No. As for now, ATOM only supports supervised machine learning pipelines. However, various unsupervised algorithms can be chosen as strategy in the Pruner class to detect and remove outliers from the dataset.</p> Is there a way to plot multiple models in the same shap plot? <p>No. Unfortunately, there is no way to plot multiple models in the same shap plot since the plots are made by the shap package and passed as <code>matplotlib.axes</code> objects to atom. This means that it's not within the reach of this package to implement such a utility.</p> Can I merge a sklearn pipeline with atom? <p>Yes. Like any other transformer, it is possible to add a sklearn pipeline to atom using the add method. Every transformer in the pipeline is merged independently. The pipeline is not allowed to end with a model since atom manages its own models. If that is the case, add the pipeline using <code>atom.add(pipeline[:-1])</code>.</p> Is it possible to initialize atom with an existing train and test set? <p>Yes. If you already have a separated train and test set you can initialize atom in two ways:</p> <ul> <li><code>atom = ATOMClassifier(train, test)</code></li> <li><code>atom = ATOMClassifier((X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test))</code></li> </ul> <p>Make sure the train and test size have the same number of columns! If atom is initialized in any of these two ways, the <code>test_size</code> parameter is ignored.</p> Can I train the models using cross-validation? <p>Applying cross-validation means transforming every step of the pipeline multiple times, each with different results. Doing this would prevent ATOM from being able to show the transformation results after every pre-processing step, which means losing the ability to inspect how a transformer changed the dataset. For this reason, it is not possible to apply cross-validation until after a model has been trained. After a model has been trained, the pipeline is defined, and cross-validation can be applied using the cross_validate method. See here an example using cross-validation.</p> Is there a way to process datetime features? <p>Yes, the FeatureExtractor class can automatically extract useful features (day, month, year, etc...) from datetime columns. The extracted features are always encoded to numerical values, so they can be fed directly to a model.</p>"}, {"location": "getting_started/", "title": "Getting started", "text": ""}, {"location": "getting_started/#installation", "title": "Installation", "text": "<p>Install ATOM's newest release easily via <code>pip</code>:</p> <pre><code>pip install -U atom-ml\n</code></pre> <p>or via <code>conda</code>:</p> <pre><code>conda install -c conda-forge atom-ml\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Since atom was already taken, download the package under the name <code>atom-ml</code>!</p> <p></p> <p>Optional dependencies</p> <p>Some specific models, utility methods or plots require the installation of additional libraries.

When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise\\n&gt;more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the\\n&gt;extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but\\n&gt;smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I\\'m always afraid\\n&gt;that this method will stop working someday, but usually\\n&gt;I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check.\\n&gt;This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion\\n&gt;of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting\\n&gt;(that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle-\\n&gt;dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.\\n\\nAs mentioned in Adiposity 101, only some experience weight\\nrebound.

When there are more than two, the columns can be encoded using one-hot encoding or any other strategy of the category-encoders package, depending on the value of the <code>max_onehot</code> parameter.

Values above or below a certain threshold (specified with the parameter <code>max_sigma</code>) are considered outliers.

For example, if the dataset has two input variables and both are Gaussian, the feature space forms a multidimensional Gaussian, and knowledge of this distribution can be used to identify values far from the distribution. This approach can be generalized by defining a hypersphere (ellipsoid) that covers the normal data, and data that falls outside this shape is considered an outlier. Read more in sklearn's documentation.</p> <p>Local Outlier Factor A simple approach to identifying outliers is to locate those examples that are far from the other examples in the feature space. This can work well for feature spaces with low dimensionality (few features) but becomes less reliable as the number of features is increased. The local outlier factor is a technique that attempts to harness the idea of nearest neighbors for outlier detection. Each example is assigned a score of how isolated or how likely it is to be outliers based on the size of its local neighborhood. Those examples with the largest score are more likely to be outliers.

Read more in sklearn's documentation.</li> <li>If <code>engine</code> is \"sklearnex\" or \"cuml\", the estimator   used is the package's PCA implementation. Sparse data is not supported for   neither engine.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> Selection from model SFM uses an estimator with <code>feature_importances_</code> or <code>coef_</code> attributes to select the best features in a dataset based on importance weights. The estimator is provided through the <code>solver</code> parameter and can be already fitted. ATOM allows you to use one its predefined models, e.g. <code>solver=\"RF\"</code>. If you didn't call the FeatureSelector through atom, don't forget to indicate the estimator's task adding <code>_class</code> or <code>_reg</code> after the name, e.g. <code>RF_class</code> to use a random forest classifier. Read more in sklearn's documentation.</p> <p></p> <p> Sequential Feature Selection Sequential feature selection adds (forward selection) or removes (backward selection) features to form a feature subset in a greedy fashion. At each stage, this estimator chooses the best feature to add or remove based on the cross-validation score of an estimator. Read more in sklearn's documentation.</p> <p></p> <p> Recursive Feature Elimination Select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features, and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a <code>coef_</code> or through a <code>feature_importances_</code> attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features. That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached. Note that, since RFE needs to fit the model again every iteration, this method can be fairly slow.</p> <p>RFECV applies the same algorithm as RFE but uses a cross-validated metric (under the scoring parameter, see RFECV) to assess every step's performance. Also, where RFE returns the number of features selected by <code>n_features</code>, RFECV returns the number of features that achieved the optimal score on the specified metric. Note that this is not always equal to the amount specified by <code>n_features</code>.

Different models are better suited for different types of data and different types of problems. You can follow some rough guide on how to approach problems with regard to which model to try, but these are incomplete at best.</p> <p>During the exploration phase of a machine learning project, a data scientist tries to find the optimal pipeline for his specific use case. This usually involves applying standard data cleaning steps, creating or selecting useful features, trying out different models, etc. Testing multiple pipelines requires many lines of code, and writing it all in the same notebook often makes it long and cluttered. On the other hand, using multiple notebooks makes it harder to compare the results and to keep an overview. On top of that, refactoring the code for every test can be quite time-consuming. How many times have you conducted the same action to pre-process a raw dataset? How many times have you copy-and-pasted code from an old repository to re-use it in a new use case?</p> <p>Although best practices tell us to start with a simple model and build up to more complicated ones, many data scientists just use the model best known to them in order to avoid the aforementioned problems. This can result in poor performance (because the model is just not the right one for the task) or in inefficient management of time and computing resources (because a simpler/faster model could have achieved a similar performance).</p> <p>ATOM is here to help solve these common issues. The package acts as a wrapper of the whole machine learning pipeline, helping the data scientist to rapidly find a good model for his problem. Avoid endless imports and documentation lookups. Avoid rewriting the same code over and over again. With just a few lines of code, it's now possible to perform basic data cleaning steps, select relevant features and compare the performance of multiple models on a given dataset, providing quick insights on which pipeline performs best for the task at hand.</p> <p>It is important to realize that ATOM is not here to replace all the work a data scientist has to do before getting his model into production.

Note that, if the dataset is relatively small, the tuning's best score can consistently be lower than the final score on the test set due to the considerable lower fraction of instances on which it is trained.
