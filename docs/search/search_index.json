If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to create a new discussion or post them on the Slack channel! </p> <p>??? faq Is this package related to the Atom text editor?\"     There is, indeed, a text editor with the same name and a similar logo as     this package. Is this a shameless copy? No. When I started the project,     I didn't know about the text editor, and it doesn't require much thinking     to come up with the idea of replacing the letter O of the word atom with     the image of an atom.</p> How does ATOM relate to AutoML? <p>ATOM is not an AutoML tool since it does not automate the search for an optimal pipeline like well-known AutoML tools such as auto-sklearn or EvalML do. Instead, ATOM helps the user find the optimal pipeline himself. One of the goals of this package is to help data scientists produce explainable pipelines, and using an AutoML black box function would impede that.</p> Is it possible to run deep learning models? <p>Yes. Deep learning models can be added as custom models to the pipeline as long as they follow sklearn's API. For more information, see the deep learning section of the user guide.</p> Can I run atom's methods on just a subset of the columns? <p>Yes, all data cleaning and feature engineering methods accept a <code>columns</code> parameter to only transform the selected features. For example, to only impute the numerical columns in the dataset we could type <code>atom.impute(strat_num=\"mean\", columns=atom.numerical)</code>. The parameter accepts column names, column indices, dtypes or a slice object.</p> How can I compare the same model on different datasets? <p>In many occasions you might want to test how a model performs on datasets processed with different pipelines. For this, atom has the branch system. Create a new branch for every new pipeline you want to test and use the plot methods to compare all models, independent of the branch it was trained on.</p> Can I train models through atom using a GPU? <p>Yes. Refer to the user guide to see what algorithms and models have a GPU implementation. Be aware that it could require additional software and hardware dependencies.</p> How are numerical and categorical columns differentiated? <p>The columns are separated using a dataframe's select_dtypes method. Numerical columns are selected using <code>include=\"number\"</code> whereas categorical columns are selected using <code>exclude=\"number\"</code>.</p> Can I run unsupervised learning pipelines? <p>No. As for now, ATOM only supports supervised machine learning pipelines. However, various unsupervised algorithms can be chosen as strategy in the Pruner class to detect and remove outliers from the dataset.</p> Is there a way to plot multiple models in the same shap plot? <p>No. Unfortunately, there is no way to plot multiple models in the same shap plot since the plots are made by the shap package and passed as <code>matplotlib.axes</code> objects to atom. This means that it's not within the reach of this package to implement such a utility.</p> Can I merge a sklearn pipeline with atom? <p>Yes. Like any other transformer, it is possible to add a sklearn pipeline to atom using the add method. Every transformer in the pipeline is merged independently. The pipeline is not allowed to end with a model since atom manages its own models. If that is the case, add the pipeline using <code>atom.add(pipeline[:-1])</code>.</p> Is it possible to initialize atom with an existing train and test set? <p>Yes. If you already have a separated train and test set you can initialize atom in two ways:</p> <ul> <li><code>atom = ATOMClassifier(train, test)</code></li> <li><code>atom = ATOMClassifier((X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test))</code></li> </ul> <p>Make sure the train and test size have the same number of columns! If atom is initialized in any of these two ways, the <code>test_size</code> parameter is ignored.</p> Can I train the models using cross-validation? <p>Applying cross-validation means transforming every step of the pipeline multiple times, each with different results. Doing this would prevent ATOM from being able to show the transformation results after every pre-processing step, which means losing the ability to inspect how a transformer changed the dataset. For this reason, it is not possible to apply cross-validation until after a model has been trained. After a model has been trained, the pipeline is defined, and cross-validation can be applied using the cross_validate method. See here an example using cross-validation.</p> Is there a way to process datetime features? <p>Yes, the FeatureExtractor class can automatically extract useful features (day, month, year, etc...) from datetime columns. The extracted features are always encoded to numerical values, so they can be fed directly to a model.</p>"}, {"location": "getting_started/", "title": "Getting started", "text": ""}, {"location": "getting_started/#installation", "title": "Installation", "text": "<p>Install ATOM's newest release easily via <code>pip</code>:</p> <pre><code>pip install -U atom-ml\n</code></pre> <p>or via <code>conda</code>:</p> <pre><code>conda install -c conda-forge atom-ml\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Since atom was already taken, download the package under the name <code>atom-ml</code>!</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>ATOM makes use of many other ML libraries, making its dependency list quite long.

Read more in the user guide.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Decision trees based algorithms build their split rules according to one feature at a time. This means that they will fail to correctly process cyclic features since the sin/cos features should be considered one single coordinate system.</p> <p>Parametersfeatures: str or sequence, default=(\"year\", \"month\", \"day\") Features to create from the datetime columns. Note that created features with zero variance (e.g., the feature hour in a column that only contains dates) are ignored. Allowed values are datetime attributes from <code>pandas.Series.dt</code>. <p>fmt: str, dict or None, default=None Format (<code>strptime</code>) of the categorical columns that need to be converted to datetime. If dict, use the column's name as key and the format as value. If None, the format is inferred automatically from the first non NaN value. Values that cannot be converted are returned as <code>NaT</code>. <p>encoding_type: str, default=\"ordinal\" Type of encoding to use. Choose from: <ul> <li>\"ordinal\": Encode features in increasing order.</li> <li>\"cyclic\": Encode features using sine and cosine to capture   their cyclic nature. This approach creates two columns for   every feature. Non-cyclic features still use ordinal encoding.</li> </ul> <p>from_index: bool, default=False Whether to use the index as the datetime column to convert. <p>drop_columns: bool, default=True Whether to drop the original columns after transformation. This parameter is ignored if <code>from_index=True</code>. <p>verbose: int, default=0 Verbosity level of the class. Choose from: <ul> <li>0 to not print anything.</li> <li>1 to print basic information.</li> <li>2 to print detailed information.</li> </ul> <p>Attributesfeature_names_in_: np.ndarray Names of features seen during <code>fit</code>. <p>n_features_in_: int Number of features seen during <code>fit</code>. <p></p> <p></p> <p>See Also</p> <p>FeatureGenerator Generate new features.</p> <p>FeatureGrouper Extract statistics from similar features.</p> <p>FeatureSelector Reduce the number of features in the data.</p> <p></p>"}, {"location": "API/feature_engineering/featureextractor/#example", "title": "Example", "text": "atomstand-alone <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;

I think all\\n&gt;&gt;of us cycle.  One\\'s success depends on how large the fluctuations\\n&gt;&gt;in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.  Unfortunately,\\n&gt;&gt;I\\'m not one of them.\\n&gt;&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;\\n&gt;This certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is\\n&gt;a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to\\n&gt;be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not\\n&gt;put on too much weight. When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise\\n&gt;more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the\\n&gt;extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but\\n&gt;smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I\\'m always afraid\\n&gt;that this method will stop working someday, but usually\\n&gt;I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check.\\n&gt;This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion\\n&gt;of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting\\n&gt;(that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle-\\n&gt;dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.\\n\\nAs mentioned in Adiposity 101, only some experience weight\\nrebound.

For example, if the dataset has two input variables and both are Gaussian, the feature space forms a multidimensional Gaussian, and knowledge of this distribution can be used to identify values far from the distribution. This approach can be generalized by defining a hypersphere (ellipsoid) that covers the normal data, and data that falls outside this shape is considered an outlier. Read more in sklearn's documentation.</p> <p>Local Outlier Factor A simple approach to identifying outliers is to locate those examples that are far from the other examples in the feature space. This can work well for feature spaces with low dimensionality (few features) but becomes less reliable as the number of features is increased. The local outlier factor is a technique that attempts to harness the idea of nearest neighbors for outlier detection.

The number of sets can be chosen through the <code>n_bootstrap</code> parameter.</p> <p>See here a bootstrapping example.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Use the plot_bootstrap method to plot the boostrap scores in a boxplot.</p> <p></p>"}, {"location": "user_guide/training/#successive-halving", "title": "Successive halving", "text": "<p>Successive halving is a bandit-based algorithm that fits N models to 1/N of the data. The best half are selected to go to the next iteration where the process is repeated. This continues until only one model remains, which is fitted on the complete dataset. Beware that a model's performance can depend greatly on the amount of data on which it is trained. For this reason, we recommend only to use this technique with similar models, e.g., only using tree-based models.</p> <p>Run successive halving from atom via the successive_halving method.
