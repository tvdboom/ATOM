If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to create a new discussion or post them on the Slack channel ! ??? faq Is this package related to the Atom text editor?\" There is, indeed, a text editor with the same name and a similar logo as this package. Is this a shameless copy? No. When I started the project, I didn't know about the text editor, and it doesn't require much thinking to come up with the idea of replacing the letter O of the word atom with the image of an atom. How does ATOM relate to AutoML? ATOM is not an AutoML tool since it does not automate the search for an optimal pipeline like well known AutoML tools such as auto-sklearn or EvalML do. Instead, ATOM helps the user find the optimal pipeline himself. One of the goals of this package is to help data scientists produce explainable pipelines, and using an AutoML black box function would impede that. That said, it is possible to integrate a EvalML pipeline with atom through the automl method. Is it possible to run deep learning models? Yes. Deep learning models can be added as custom models to the pipeline as long as they follow sklearn's API . For more information, see the deep learning section of the user guide. Can I run atom's methods on just a subset of the columns? Yes, all data cleaning and feature engineering methods accept a columns parameter to only transform the selected features. For example, to only impute the numerical columns in the dataset we could type atom.impute(strat_num=\"mean\", columns=atom.numerical) . The parameter accepts column names, column indices, dtypes or a slice object. How can I compare the same model on different datasets? In many occasions you might want to test how a model performs on datasets processed with different pipelines. For this, atom has the branch system . Create a new branch for every new pipeline you want to test and use the plot methods to compare all models, independent of the branch it was trained on. Can I train models through atom using a GPU? Yes. Refer to the user guide to see what algorithms and models have a GPU implementation. Be aware that it requires additional software and hardware dependencies. How are numerical and categorical columns differentiated? The columns are separated using a dataframe's select_dtypes method. Numerical columns are selected using include=\"number\" whereas categorical columns are selected using exclude=\"number\" . Can I run unsupervised learning pipelines? No. As for now, ATOM only supports supervised machine learning pipelines. However, various unsupervised algorithms can be chosen as strategy in the Pruner class to detect and remove outliers from the dataset. Is there a way to plot multiple models in the same shap plot? No. Unfortunately, there is no way to plot multiple models in the same shap plot since the plots are made by the shap package and passed as matplotlib.axes objects to atom. This means that it's not within the reach of this package to implement such a utility. Can I merge a sklearn pipeline with atom? Yes. Like any other transformer, it is possible to add a sklearn pipeline to atom using the add method. Every transformer in the pipeline is merged independently. The pipeline is not allowed to end with a model since atom manages its own models. If that is the case, add the pipeline using atom.add(pipeline[:-1]) . Is it possible to initialize atom with an existing train and test set? Yes. If you already have a separated train and test set you can initialize atom in two ways: atom = ATOMClassifier(train, test) atom = ATOMClassifier((X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test)) Make sure the train and test size have the same number of columns! If atom is initialized in any of these two ways, the test_size parameter is ignored. Can I train the models using cross-validation? Applying cross-validation means transforming every step of the pipeline multiple times, each with different results. Doing this would prevent ATOM from being able to show the transformation results after every pre-processing step, which means losing the ability to inspect how a transformer changed the dataset. For this reason, it is not possible to apply cross-validation until after a model has been trained. After a model has been trained, the pipeline is defined, and cross-validation can be applied using the cross_validate method. See here an example using cross-validation. Is there a way to process datetime features? Yes, the FeatureExtractor class can automatically extract useful features (day, month, year, etc...) from datetime columns. The extracted features are always encoded to numerical values, so they can be fed directly to a model.", "title": "FAQ"}, {"location": "faq/#frequently-asked-questions", "text": "Here we try to give answers to some questions that have popped up regularly.

Utility methods Next to the plotting methods, the class contains a variety of utility methods to handle the data and manage the pipeline. add Add a transformer to the pipeline. apply Apply a function to the dataset. automl Search for an optimized pipeline in an automated fashion. available_models Give an overview of the available predefined models. canvas Create a figure with multiple plots. clear Reset attributes and clear cache from all models. delete Delete models. distribution Get statistics on column distributions. eda Create an Exploratory Data Analysis report. evaluate Get all models' scores for the provided metrics. export_pipeline Export the pipeline to a sklearn-like object. get_class_weight Return class weights for a balanced dataset. inverse_transform Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. load Loads an atom instance from a pickle file. log Print message and save to log file. merge Merge another instance of the same class into this one. update_layout Update the properties of the plot's layout. reset Reset the instance to it's initial state. reset_aesthetics Reset the plot aesthetics to their default values. save Save the instance to a pickle file. save_data Save the data in the current branch to a .csv file. shrink Converts the columns to the smallest possible matching dtype. stacking Add a Stacking model to the pipeline. stats Print basic information about the dataset. status Get an overview of the branches and models. transform Transform new data through the pipeline. voting Add a Voting model to the pipeline. method add (transformer, columns=None, train_only=False, **fit_params) [source] Add a transformer to the pipeline. If the transformer is not fitted, it is fitted on the complete training set. Afterwards, the data set is transformed and the estimator is added to atom's pipeline. If the estimator is a sklearn Pipeline, every estimator is merged independently with atom. Warning The transformer should have fit and/or transform methods with arguments X (accepting a dataframe-like object of shape=(n_samples, n_features)) and/or y (accepting a sequence of shape=(n_samples,)). The transform method should return a feature set as a dataframe-like object of shape=(n_samples, n_features) and/or a target column as a sequence of shape=(n_samples,). Note If the transform method doesn't return a dataframe: The column naming happens as follows. If the transformer has a get_feature_names or get_feature_names_out method, it is used. If not, and it returns the same number of columns, the names are kept equal. If the number of columns change, old columns will keep their name (as long as the column is unchanged) and new columns will receive the name x[N-1] , where N stands for the n-th feature. This means that a transformer should only transform, add or drop columns, not combinations of these. The index remains the same as before the transformation. This means that the transformer should not add, remove or shuffle rows unless it returns a dataframe. Note If the transformer has a n_jobs and/or random_state parameter that is left to its default value, it adopts atom's value. Parameters transformer: Transformer Estimator to add to the pipeline. Should implement a transform method. columns: int, str, slice, sequence or None, default=None Names, indices or dtypes of the columns in the dataset to transform. If None, transform all columns. Add ! in front of a name or dtype to exclude that column, e.g. atom.add(Transformer(), columns=\"!Location\") transforms all columns except Location`. You can either include or exclude columns, not combinations of these. The target column is always included if required by the transformer. train_only: bool, default=False Whether to apply the estimator only on the training set or on the complete dataset. Note that if True, the transformation is skipped when making predictions on new data. **fit_params Additional keyword arguments for the transformer's fit method. method apply (func, inverse_func=None, kw_args=None, inv_kw_args=None, **kwargs) [source] Apply a function to the dataset. The function should have signature func(dataset, **kw_args) -> dataset . This method is useful for stateless transformations such as taking the log, doing custom scaling, etc... Note This approach is preferred over changing the dataset directly through the property's @setter since the transformation is stored in the pipeline. Tip Use atom . apply ( lambda df : df . drop ( \"column_name\" , axis = 1 )) to store the removal of columns in the pipeline. Parameters func: callable Function to apply. inverse_func: callable or None, default=None Inverse function of func . If None, the inverse_transform method returns the input unchanged. kw_args: dict or None, default=None Additional keyword arguments for the function. inv_kw_args: dict or None, default=None Additional keyword arguments for the inverse function. method automl (**kwargs) [source] Search for an optimized pipeline in an automated fashion. Automated machine learning (AutoML) automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning pipelines. Automating the machine learning often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms. ATOM uses the evalML package for AutoML optimization. The resulting transformers and final estimator are merged with atom's pipeline (check the pipeline and models attributes after the method finishes running). The created AutoMLSearch instance can be accessed through the evalml attribute. Warning AutoML algorithms aren't intended to run for only a few minutes. The method may need a very long time to achieve optimal results. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the AutoMLSearch instance. method available_models () [source] Give an overview of the available predefined models. Returns pd.DataFrame Information about the available predefined models .

If str: Location where to show the legend. If dict: Legend configuration. figsize: tuple or None, default=None Figure's size in pixels, format as (x, y). If None, it adapts the size to the number of plots in the canvas. filename: str or None, default=None Save the plot using this name. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. The type of the file depends on the provided name (.html, .png, .pdf, etc...). If filename has no file type, the plot is saved as html. If None, the plot is not saved. display: bool, default=True Whether to render the plot. Yields go.Figure Plot object. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from all models. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method delete (models=None) [source] Delete models. If all models are removed, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving .

Returns pd.DataFrame Scores of the models. method export_pipeline (model=None, memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the pipeline to a sklearn-like object. Optionally, you can add a model as final estimator. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters model: str, Model or None, default=None Model for which to export the pipeline.

This method prints the same information as the __repr__ and also saves it to the logger. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored.

Data cleaning The data cleaning methods can help you scale the data, handle missing values, categorical columns, outliers and unbalanced datasets. All attributes of the data cleaning classes are attached to atom after running. Read more in the user guide . Tip Use the eda method to examine the data and help you determine suitable parameters for the data cleaning methods. balance Balance the number of rows per class in the target column. clean Applies standard data cleaning steps on the dataset. discretize Bin continuous data into intervals. encode Perform encoding of categorical features. impute Handle missing values in the dataset. normalize Transform the data to follow a Normal/Gaussian distribution. prune Prune outliers from the training set. scale Scale the data. method balance (strategy=\"adasyn\", **kwargs) [source] Balance the number of rows per class in the target column. When oversampling, the newly created samples have an increasing integer index for numerical indices, and an index of the form [estimator]_N for non-numerical indices, where N stands for the N-th sample in the data set. See the Balancer class for a description of the parameters. Note The balance method does not support multioutput tasks . This transformation is only applied to the training set in order to maintain the original distribution of target classes in the test set. Tip Use atom's classes attribute for an overview of the target class distribution per data set. method clean (drop_types=None, strip_categorical=True, drop_duplicates=False, drop_missing_target=True, encode_target=True, **kwargs) [source] Applies standard data cleaning steps on the dataset. Use the parameters to choose which transformations to perform. The available steps are: Drop columns with specific data types. Strip categorical features from white spaces. Drop duplicate rows. Drop rows with missing values in the target column. Encode the target column (ignored for regression tasks). See the Cleaner class for a description of the parameters. method discretize (strategy=\"quantile\", bins=5, labels=None, **kwargs) [source] Bin continuous data into intervals. For each feature, the bin edges are computed during fit and, together with the number of bins, they will define the intervals. Ignores numerical columns. See the Discretizer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to visualize a column's distribution and decide on the bins. method encode (strategy=\"LeaveOneOut\", max_onehot=10, ordinal=None, rare_to_value=None, value=\"rare\", **kwargs) [source] Perform encoding of categorical features. The encoding type depends on the number of classes in the column: If n_classes=2 or ordinal feature, use Ordinal-encoding. If 2 < n_classes <= max_onehot , use OneHot-encoding. If n_classes > max_onehot , use strategy -encoding. Missing values are propagated to the output column. Unknown classes encountered during transforming are imputed according to the selected strategy. Rare classes can be replaced with a value in order to prevent too high cardinality. See the Encoder class for a description of the parameters. Note This method only encodes the categorical features. It does not encode the target column! Use the clean method for that. Tip Use the categorical attribute for a list of the categorical features in the dataset. method impute (strat_num=\"drop\", strat_cat=\"drop\", max_nan_rows=None, max_nan_cols=None, **kwargs) [source] Handle missing values in the dataset. Impute or remove missing values according to the selected strategy. Also removes rows and columns with too many missing values. Use the missing attribute to customize what are considered \"missing values\". See the Imputer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the nans attribute to check the amount of missing values per column. method normalize (strategy=\"yeojohnson\", **kwargs) [source] Transform the data to follow a Normal/Gaussian distribution. This transformation is useful for modeling issues related to heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance), or other situations where normality is desired. Missing values are disregarded in fit and maintained in transform. Ignores categorical columns. See the Normalizer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to examine a column's distribution. method prune (strategy=\"zscore\", method=\"drop\", max_sigma=3, include_target=False, **kwargs) [source] Prune outliers from the training set. Replace or remove outliers. The definition of outlier depends on the selected strategy and can greatly differ from one another. Ignores categorical columns. See the Pruner class for a description of the parameters. Note This transformation is only applied to the training set in order to maintain the original distribution of samples in the test set. Tip Use the outliers attribute to check the number of outliers per column. method scale (strategy=\"standard\", include_binary=False, **kwargs) [source] Scale the data. Apply one of sklearn's scalers. Categorical columns are ignored. See the Scaler class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the scaled attribute to check whether the dataset is scaled. NLP The Natural Language Processing (NLP) transformers help to convert raw text to meaningful numeric values, ready to be ingested by a model. All transformations are applied only on the column in the dataset called corpus . Read more in the user guide . textclean Applies standard text cleaning to the corpus. textnormalize Normalize the corpus. tokenize Tokenize the corpus. vectorize Vectorize the corpus. method textclean (decode=True, lower_case=True, drop_email=True, regex_email=None, drop_url=True, regex_url=None, drop_html=True, regex_html=None, drop_emoji=True, regex_emoji=None, drop_number=True, regex_number=None, drop_punctuation=True, **kwargs) [source] Applies standard text cleaning to the corpus. Transformations include normalizing characters and dropping noise from the text (emails, HTML tags, URLs, etc...). The transformations are applied on the column named corpus , in the same order the parameters are presented. If there is no column with that name, an exception is raised. See the TextCleaner class for a description of the parameters. method textnormalize (stopwords=True, custom_stopwords=None, stem=False, lemmatize=True, **kwargs) [source] Normalize the corpus. Convert words to a more uniform standard. The transformations are applied on the column named corpus , in the same order the parameters are presented. If there is no column with that name, an exception is raised. If the provided documents are strings, words are separated by spaces. See the TextNormalizer class for a description of the parameters. method tokenize (bigram_freq=None, trigram_freq=None, quadgram_freq=None, **kwargs) [source] Tokenize the corpus. Convert documents into sequences of words. Additionally, create n-grams (represented by words united with underscores, e.g. \"New_York\") based on their frequency in the corpus. The transformations are applied on the column named corpus . If there is no column with that name, an exception is raised. See the Tokenizer class for a description of the parameters. method vectorize (strategy=\"bow\", return_sparse=True, **kwargs) [source] Vectorize the corpus. Transform the corpus into meaningful vectors of numbers. The transformation is applied on the column named corpus . If there is no column with that name, an exception is raised. If strategy=\"bow\" or \"tfidf\", the transformed columns are named after the word they are embedding with the prefix corpus_ . If strategy=\"hashing\", the columns are named hash[N], where N stands for the n-th hashed column. See the Vectorizer class for a description of the parameters. Feature engineering To further pre-process the data, it's possible to extract features from datetime columns, create new non-linear features transforming the existing ones, group similar features or, if the dataset is too large, remove features. Read more in the user guide . feature_extraction Extract features from datetime columns. feature_generation Generate new features. feature_grouping Extract statistics from similar features. feature_selection Reduce the number of features in the data. method feature_extraction (features=['day', 'month', 'year'], fmt=None, encoding_type=\"ordinal\", drop_columns=True, **kwargs) [source] Extract features from datetime columns. Create new features extracting datetime elements (day, month, year, etc...) from the provided columns. Columns of dtype datetime64 are used as is. Categorical columns that can be successfully converted to a datetime format (less than 30% NaT values after conversion) are also used. See the FeatureExtractor class for a description of the parameters. method feature_generation (strategy=\"dfs\", n_features=None, operators=None, **kwargs) [source] Generate new features. Create new combinations of existing features to capture the non-linear relations between the original features. See the FeatureGenerator class for a description of the parameters. method feature_grouping (group, name=None, operators=None, drop_columns=True, **kwargs) [source] Extract statistics from similar features. Replace groups of features with related characteristics with new features that summarize statistical properties of te group. The statistical operators are calculated over every row of the group. The group names and features can be accessed through the groups method. See the FeatureGrouper class for a description of the parameters. method feature_selection (strategy=None, solver=None, n_features=None, min_repeated=2, max_repeated=1.0, max_correlation=1.0, **kwargs) [source] Reduce the number of features in the data. Apply feature selection or dimensionality reduction, either to improve the estimators' accuracy or to boost their performance on very high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, remove multicollinear and low variance features. See the FeatureSelector class for a description of the parameters. Note When strategy=\"univariate\" and solver=None, f_classif or f_regression is used as default solver. When strategy is \"sfs\", \"rfecv\" or any of the advanced strategies and no scoring is specified, atom's metric (if it exists) is used as scoring. Training The training methods are where the models are fitted to the data and their performance is evaluated against a selected metric. There are three methods to call the three different training approaches. Read more in the user guide . run Train and evaluate the models in a direct fashion. successive_halving Fit the models in a successive halving fashion. train_sizing Train and evaluate the models in a train sizing fashion. method run (models=None, metric=None, est_params=None, n_trials=0, ht_params=None, n_bootstrap=0, **kwargs) [source] Train and evaluate the models in a direct fashion. Contrary to successive_halving and train_sizing , the direct approach only iterates once over the models, using the full dataset. The following steps are applied to every model: Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional). See the DirectClassifier or DirectRegressor class for a description of the parameters. method successive_halving (models, metric=None, skip_runs=0, est_params=None, n_trials=0, ht_params=None, n_bootstrap=0, **kwargs) [source] Fit the models in a successive halving fashion. The successive halving technique is a bandit-based algorithm that fits N models to 1/N of the data. The best half are selected to go to the next iteration where the process is repeated. This continues until only one model remains, which is fitted on the complete dataset. Beware that a model's performance can depend greatly on the amount of data on which it is trained. For this reason, it is recommended to only use this technique with similar models, e.g. only using tree-based models. The following steps are applied to every model (per iteration): Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional). See the SuccessiveHalvingClassifier or SuccessiveHalvingRegressor class for a description of the parameters. method train_sizing (models, metric=None, train_sizes=5, est_params=None, n_trials=0, ht_params=None, n_bootstrap=0, **kwargs) [source] Train and evaluate the models in a train sizing fashion. When training models, there is usually a trade-off between model performance and computation time, that is regulated by the number of samples in the training set. This method can be used to create insights in this trade-off, and help determine the optimal size of the training set. The models are fitted multiple times, ever-increasing the number of samples in the training set. The following steps are applied to every model (per iteration): Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional).

If the transformer is not fitted, it is fitted on the complete training set. Afterwards, the data set is transformed and the estimator is added to atom's pipeline. If the estimator is a sklearn Pipeline, every estimator is merged independently with atom. Warning The transformer should have fit and/or transform methods with arguments X (accepting a dataframe-like object of shape=(n_samples, n_features)) and/or y (accepting a sequence of shape=(n_samples,)). The transform method should return a feature set as a dataframe-like object of shape=(n_samples, n_features) and/or a target column as a sequence of shape=(n_samples,). Note If the transform method doesn't return a dataframe: The column naming happens as follows. If the transformer has a get_feature_names or get_feature_names_out method, it is used. If not, and it returns the same number of columns, the names are kept equal. If the number of columns change, old columns will keep their name (as long as the column is unchanged) and new columns will receive the name x[N-1] , where N stands for the n-th feature. This means that a transformer should only transform, add or drop columns, not combinations of these. The index remains the same as before the transformation. This means that the transformer should not add, remove or shuffle rows unless it returns a dataframe. Note If the transformer has a n_jobs and/or random_state parameter that is left to its default value, it adopts atom's value. Parameters transformer: Transformer Estimator to add to the pipeline. Should implement a transform method. columns: int, str, slice, sequence or None, default=None Names, indices or dtypes of the columns in the dataset to transform. If None, transform all columns. Add ! in front of a name or dtype to exclude that column, e.g. atom.add(Transformer(), columns=\"!Location\") transforms all columns except Location`. You can either include or exclude columns, not combinations of these. The target column is always included if required by the transformer. train_only: bool, default=False Whether to apply the estimator only on the training set or on the complete dataset. Note that if True, the transformation is skipped when making predictions on new data. **fit_params Additional keyword arguments for the transformer's fit method. method apply (func, inverse_func=None, kw_args=None, inv_kw_args=None, **kwargs) [source] Apply a function to the dataset. The function should have signature func(dataset, **kw_args) -> dataset . This method is useful for stateless transformations such as taking the log, doing custom scaling, etc... Note This approach is preferred over changing the dataset directly through the property's @setter since the transformation is stored in the pipeline. Tip Use atom . apply ( lambda df : df . drop ( \"column_name\" , axis = 1 )) to store the removal of columns in the pipeline. Parameters func: callable Function to apply. inverse_func: callable or None, default=None Inverse function of func . If None, the inverse_transform method returns the input unchanged. kw_args: dict or None, default=None Additional keyword arguments for the function. inv_kw_args: dict or None, default=None Additional keyword arguments for the inverse function. method automl (**kwargs) [source] Search for an optimized pipeline in an automated fashion. Automated machine learning (AutoML) automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning pipelines. Automating the machine learning often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms. ATOM uses the evalML package for AutoML optimization. The resulting transformers and final estimator are merged with atom's pipeline (check the pipeline and models attributes after the method finishes running). The created AutoMLSearch instance can be accessed through the evalml attribute. Warning AutoML algorithms aren't intended to run for only a few minutes. The method may need a very long time to achieve optimal results. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the AutoMLSearch instance. method available_models () [source] Give an overview of the available predefined models. Returns pd.DataFrame Information about the available predefined models .

If None, it adapts the size to the number of plots in the canvas. filename: str or None, default=None Save the plot using this name. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. The type of the file depends on the provided name (.html, .png, .pdf, etc...). If filename has no file type, the plot is saved as html. If None, the plot is not saved. display: bool, default=True Whether to render the plot. Yields go.Figure Plot object. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from all models. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method delete (models=None) [source] Delete models. If all models are removed, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving . Deleted models are not removed from any active mlflow experiment . Parameters models: int, str, slice, Model, sequence or None, default=None Models to delete. If None, all models are deleted. method distribution (distributions=None, columns=None) [source] Get statistics on column distributions. Compute the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for various distributions against columns in the dataset. Only for numerical columns. Missing values are ignored. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to plot a column's distribution. Parameters distributions: str, sequence or None, default=None Names of the distributions in scipy.stats to get the statistics on. If None, a selection of the most common ones is used. columns: int, str, slice, sequence or None, default=None Names, positions or dtypes of the columns in the dataset to perform the test on. If None, select all numerical columns. Returns pd.DataFrame Statistic results with multiindex levels: dist: Name of the distribution. stat: Statistic results: score: KS-test score. p_value: Corresponding p-value. method eda (dataset=\"dataset\", n_rows=None, filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an Exploratory Data Analysis report. ATOM uses the pandas-profiling package for the EDA. The report is rendered directly in the notebook. The created ProfileReport instance can be accessed through the report attribute. Warning This method can be slow for large datasets. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"dataset\" Data set to get the report from. n_rows: int or None, default=None Number of (randomly picked) rows to process. None to use all rows. filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html).

Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metric to calculate. If None, it returns an overview of the most common metrics per task. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.DataFrame Scores of the models. method export_pipeline (model=None, memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the pipeline to a sklearn-like object. Optionally, you can add a model as final estimator. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters model: str, Model or None, default=None Model for which to export the pipeline. If the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. If None, the pipeline in the current branch is exported. memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Sklearn-like Pipeline object with all transformers in the current branch. method get_class_weight (dataset=\"train\", target=0) [source] Return class weights for a balanced dataset. Statistically, the class weights re-balance the data set so that the sampled data set represents the target population as closely as possible. The returned weights are inversely proportional to the class frequencies in the selected data set. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"train\" Data set from which to get the weights. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"dataset\". target: int or str, default=0 Target column to get the class weights from. Only for multioutput tasks .

When oversampling, the newly created samples have an increasing integer index for numerical indices, and an index of the form [estimator]_N for non-numerical indices, where N stands for the N-th sample in the data set. See the Balancer class for a description of the parameters. Note The balance method does not support multioutput tasks . This transformation is only applied to the training set in order to maintain the original distribution of target classes in the test set. Tip Use atom's classes attribute for an overview of the target class distribution per data set. method clean (drop_types=None, strip_categorical=True, drop_duplicates=False, drop_missing_target=True, encode_target=True, **kwargs) [source] Applies standard data cleaning steps on the dataset.

Drop rows with missing values in the target column. Encode the target column (ignored for regression tasks). See the Cleaner class for a description of the parameters. method discretize (strategy=\"quantile\", bins=5, labels=None, **kwargs) [source] Bin continuous data into intervals. For each feature, the bin edges are computed during fit and, together with the number of bins, they will define the intervals. Ignores numerical columns. See the Discretizer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to visualize a column's distribution and decide on the bins. method encode (strategy=\"LeaveOneOut\", max_onehot=10, ordinal=None, rare_to_value=None, value=\"rare\", **kwargs) [source] Perform encoding of categorical features. The encoding type depends on the number of classes in the column: If n_classes=2 or ordinal feature, use Ordinal-encoding. If 2 < n_classes <= max_onehot , use OneHot-encoding. If n_classes > max_onehot , use strategy -encoding. Missing values are propagated to the output column. Unknown classes encountered during transforming are imputed according to the selected strategy. Rare classes can be replaced with a value in order to prevent too high cardinality. See the Encoder class for a description of the parameters. Note This method only encodes the categorical features. It does not encode the target column! Use the clean method for that.

Contrary to successive_halving and train_sizing , the direct approach only iterates once over the models, using the full dataset. The following steps are applied to every model: Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional). See the DirectClassifier or DirectRegressor class for a description of the parameters. method successive_halving (models, metric=None, skip_runs=0, est_params=None, n_trials=0, ht_params=None, n_bootstrap=0, **kwargs) [source] Fit the models in a successive halving fashion. The successive halving technique is a bandit-based algorithm that fits N models to 1/N of the data. The best half are selected to go to the next iteration where the process is repeated. This continues until only one model remains, which is fitted on the complete dataset. Beware that a model's performance can depend greatly on the amount of data on which it is trained. For this reason, it is recommended to only use this technique with similar models, e.g. only using tree-based models. The following steps are applied to every model (per iteration): Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional).

Note that methods that apply on the pipeline can return different results per branch. __repr__: Prints an overview of atom's branches, models, metric and errors. __len__: Returns the length of the dataset. __iter__: Iterate over the pipeline's transformers. __contains__: Checks if the provided item is a column in the dataset. __getitem__: Access a branch, model, column or subset of the dataset. Attributes Data attributes The data attributes are used to access the dataset and its properties. Updating the dataset will automatically update the response of these attributes accordingly. Attributes pipeline: pd.Series Transformers fitted on the data. Use this attribute only to access the individual instances. To visualize the pipeline, use the plot_pipeline method. mapping: dict Encoded values and their respective mapped values. The column name is the key to its mapping dictionary.

Utility methods Next to the plotting methods, the class contains a variety of utility methods to handle the data and manage the pipeline. add Add a transformer to the pipeline. apply Apply a function to the dataset. automl Search for an optimized pipeline in an automated fashion. available_models Give an overview of the available predefined models. canvas Create a figure with multiple plots. clear Reset attributes and clear cache from all models. delete Delete models. distribution Get statistics on column distributions. eda Create an Exploratory Data Analysis report. evaluate Get all models' scores for the provided metrics. export_pipeline Export the pipeline to a sklearn-like object. get_class_weight Return class weights for a balanced dataset. inverse_transform Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. load Loads an atom instance from a pickle file. log Print message and save to log file. merge Merge another instance of the same class into this one. update_layout Update the properties of the plot's layout. reset Reset the instance to it's initial state. reset_aesthetics Reset the plot aesthetics to their default values. save Save the instance to a pickle file. save_data Save the data in the current branch to a .csv file. shrink Converts the columns to the smallest possible matching dtype. stacking Add a Stacking model to the pipeline. stats Print basic information about the dataset. status Get an overview of the branches and models. transform Transform new data through the pipeline. voting Add a Voting model to the pipeline. method add (transformer, columns=None, train_only=False, **fit_params) [source] Add a transformer to the pipeline. If the transformer is not fitted, it is fitted on the complete training set. Afterwards, the data set is transformed and the estimator is added to atom's pipeline. If the estimator is a sklearn Pipeline, every estimator is merged independently with atom. Warning The transformer should have fit and/or transform methods with arguments X (accepting a dataframe-like object of shape=(n_samples, n_features)) and/or y (accepting a sequence of shape=(n_samples,)). The transform method should return a feature set as a dataframe-like object of shape=(n_samples, n_features) and/or a target column as a sequence of shape=(n_samples,). Note If the transform method doesn't return a dataframe: The column naming happens as follows. If the transformer has a get_feature_names or get_feature_names_out method, it is used. If not, and it returns the same number of columns, the names are kept equal. If the number of columns change, old columns will keep their name (as long as the column is unchanged) and new columns will receive the name x[N-1] , where N stands for the n-th feature. This means that a transformer should only transform, add or drop columns, not combinations of these. The index remains the same as before the transformation. This means that the transformer should not add, remove or shuffle rows unless it returns a dataframe. Note If the transformer has a n_jobs and/or random_state parameter that is left to its default value, it adopts atom's value. Parameters transformer: Transformer Estimator to add to the pipeline. Should implement a transform method. columns: int, str, slice, sequence or None, default=None Names, indices or dtypes of the columns in the dataset to transform. If None, transform all columns. Add ! in front of a name or dtype to exclude that column, e.g. atom.add(Transformer(), columns=\"!Location\") transforms all columns except Location`. You can either include or exclude columns, not combinations of these. The target column is always included if required by the transformer. train_only: bool, default=False Whether to apply the estimator only on the training set or on the complete dataset. Note that if True, the transformation is skipped when making predictions on new data. **fit_params Additional keyword arguments for the transformer's fit method. method apply (func, inverse_func=None, kw_args=None, inv_kw_args=None, **kwargs) [source] Apply a function to the dataset. The function should have signature func(dataset, **kw_args) -> dataset . This method is useful for stateless transformations such as taking the log, doing custom scaling, etc... Note This approach is preferred over changing the dataset directly through the property's @setter since the transformation is stored in the pipeline. Tip Use atom . apply ( lambda df : df . drop ( \"column_name\" , axis = 1 )) to store the removal of columns in the pipeline. Parameters func: callable Function to apply. inverse_func: callable or None, default=None Inverse function of func . If None, the inverse_transform method returns the input unchanged. kw_args: dict or None, default=None Additional keyword arguments for the function. inv_kw_args: dict or None, default=None Additional keyword arguments for the inverse function. method automl (**kwargs) [source] Search for an optimized pipeline in an automated fashion. Automated machine learning (AutoML) automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning pipelines. Automating the machine learning often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms. ATOM uses the evalML package for AutoML optimization. The resulting transformers and final estimator are merged with atom's pipeline (check the pipeline and models attributes after the method finishes running). The created AutoMLSearch instance can be accessed through the evalml attribute. Warning AutoML algorithms aren't intended to run for only a few minutes. The method may need a very long time to achieve optimal results. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the AutoMLSearch instance. method available_models () [source] Give an overview of the available predefined models. Returns pd.DataFrame Information about the available predefined models .

If str: Location where to show the legend. If dict: Legend configuration. figsize: tuple or None, default=None Figure's size in pixels, format as (x, y). If None, it adapts the size to the number of plots in the canvas. filename: str or None, default=None Save the plot using this name. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. The type of the file depends on the provided name (.html, .png, .pdf, etc...). If filename has no file type, the plot is saved as html. If None, the plot is not saved. display: bool, default=True Whether to render the plot. Yields go.Figure Plot object. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from all models. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method delete (models=None) [source] Delete models. If all models are removed, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving .

Returns pd.DataFrame Scores of the models. method export_pipeline (model=None, memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the pipeline to a sklearn-like object. Optionally, you can add a model as final estimator. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters model: str, Model or None, default=None Model for which to export the pipeline. If the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. If None, the pipeline in the current branch is exported. memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

Returns Pipeline Sklearn-like Pipeline object with all transformers in the current branch. method get_class_weight (dataset=\"train\", target=0) [source] Return class weights for a balanced dataset. Statistically, the class weights re-balance the data set so that the sampled data set represents the target population as closely as possible. The returned weights are inversely proportional to the class frequencies in the selected data set. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"train\" Data set from which to get the weights. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"dataset\". target: int or str, default=0 Target column to get the class weights from. Only for multioutput tasks . Returns dict Classes with the corresponding weights. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be used to transform only the target column. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features).

Data cleaning The data cleaning methods can help you scale the data, handle missing values, categorical columns and outliers. All attributes of the data cleaning classes are attached to atom after running. Read more in the user guide . Tip Use the eda method to examine the data and help you determine suitable parameters for the data cleaning methods. clean Applies standard data cleaning steps on the dataset. discretize Bin continuous data into intervals. encode Perform encoding of categorical features. impute Handle missing values in the dataset. normalize Transform the data to follow a Normal/Gaussian distribution. prune Prune outliers from the training set. scale Scale the data. method clean (drop_types=None, strip_categorical=True, drop_duplicates=False, drop_missing_target=True, encode_target=True, **kwargs) [source] Applies standard data cleaning steps on the dataset. Use the parameters to choose which transformations to perform. The available steps are: Drop columns with specific data types. Strip categorical features from white spaces. Drop duplicate rows. Drop rows with missing values in the target column. Encode the target column (ignored for regression tasks). See the Cleaner class for a description of the parameters. method discretize (strategy=\"quantile\", bins=5, labels=None, **kwargs) [source] Bin continuous data into intervals. For each feature, the bin edges are computed during fit and, together with the number of bins, they will define the intervals. Ignores numerical columns. See the Discretizer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to visualize a column's distribution and decide on the bins. method encode (strategy=\"LeaveOneOut\", max_onehot=10, ordinal=None, rare_to_value=None, value=\"rare\", **kwargs) [source] Perform encoding of categorical features. The encoding type depends on the number of classes in the column: If n_classes=2 or ordinal feature, use Ordinal-encoding. If 2 < n_classes <= max_onehot , use OneHot-encoding. If n_classes > max_onehot , use strategy -encoding. Missing values are propagated to the output column. Unknown classes encountered during transforming are imputed according to the selected strategy. Rare classes can be replaced with a value in order to prevent too high cardinality. See the Encoder class for a description of the parameters. Note This method only encodes the categorical features. It does not encode the target column! Use the clean method for that. Tip Use the categorical attribute for a list of the categorical features in the dataset. method impute (strat_num=\"drop\", strat_cat=\"drop\", max_nan_rows=None, max_nan_cols=None, **kwargs) [source] Handle missing values in the dataset. Impute or remove missing values according to the selected strategy. Also removes rows and columns with too many missing values. Use the missing attribute to customize what are considered \"missing values\". See the Imputer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the nans attribute to check the amount of missing values per column. method normalize (strategy=\"yeojohnson\", **kwargs) [source] Transform the data to follow a Normal/Gaussian distribution. This transformation is useful for modeling issues related to heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance), or other situations where normality is desired. Missing values are disregarded in fit and maintained in transform. Ignores categorical columns. See the Normalizer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to examine a column's distribution. method prune (strategy=\"zscore\", method=\"drop\", max_sigma=3, include_target=False, **kwargs) [source] Prune outliers from the training set. Replace or remove outliers. The definition of outlier depends on the selected strategy and can greatly differ from one another. Ignores categorical columns. See the Pruner class for a description of the parameters. Note This transformation is only applied to the training set in order to maintain the original distribution of samples in the test set. Tip Use the outliers attribute to check the number of outliers per column. method scale (strategy=\"standard\", include_binary=False, **kwargs) [source] Scale the data. Apply one of sklearn's scalers. Categorical columns are ignored. See the Scaler class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the scaled attribute to check whether the dataset is scaled. NLP The Natural Language Processing (NLP) transformers help to convert raw text to meaningful numeric values, ready to be ingested by a model. All transformations are applied only on the column in the dataset called corpus . Read more in the user guide . textclean Applies standard text cleaning to the corpus. textnormalize Normalize the corpus. tokenize Tokenize the corpus. vectorize Vectorize the corpus. method textclean (decode=True, lower_case=True, drop_email=True, regex_email=None, drop_url=True, regex_url=None, drop_html=True, regex_html=None, drop_emoji=True, regex_emoji=None, drop_number=True, regex_number=None, drop_punctuation=True, **kwargs) [source] Applies standard text cleaning to the corpus. Transformations include normalizing characters and dropping noise from the text (emails, HTML tags, URLs, etc...). The transformations are applied on the column named corpus , in the same order the parameters are presented. If there is no column with that name, an exception is raised. See the TextCleaner class for a description of the parameters. method textnormalize (stopwords=True, custom_stopwords=None, stem=False, lemmatize=True, **kwargs) [source] Normalize the corpus. Convert words to a more uniform standard. The transformations are applied on the column named corpus , in the same order the parameters are presented. If there is no column with that name, an exception is raised. If the provided documents are strings, words are separated by spaces. See the TextNormalizer class for a description of the parameters. method tokenize (bigram_freq=None, trigram_freq=None, quadgram_freq=None, **kwargs) [source] Tokenize the corpus. Convert documents into sequences of words. Additionally, create n-grams (represented by words united with underscores, e.g. \"New_York\") based on their frequency in the corpus. The transformations are applied on the column named corpus . If there is no column with that name, an exception is raised. See the Tokenizer class for a description of the parameters. method vectorize (strategy=\"bow\", return_sparse=True, **kwargs) [source] Vectorize the corpus. Transform the corpus into meaningful vectors of numbers. The transformation is applied on the column named corpus . If there is no column with that name, an exception is raised. If strategy=\"bow\" or \"tfidf\", the transformed columns are named after the word they are embedding with the prefix corpus_ . If strategy=\"hashing\", the columns are named hash[N], where N stands for the n-th hashed column. See the Vectorizer class for a description of the parameters. Feature engineering To further pre-process the data, it's possible to extract features from datetime columns, create new non-linear features transforming the existing ones, group similar features or, if the dataset is too large, remove features. Read more in the user guide . feature_extraction Extract features from datetime columns. feature_generation Generate new features. feature_grouping Extract statistics from similar features. feature_selection Reduce the number of features in the data. method feature_extraction (features=['day', 'month', 'year'], fmt=None, encoding_type=\"ordinal\", drop_columns=True, **kwargs) [source] Extract features from datetime columns. Create new features extracting datetime elements (day, month, year, etc...) from the provided columns. Columns of dtype datetime64 are used as is. Categorical columns that can be successfully converted to a datetime format (less than 30% NaT values after conversion) are also used. See the FeatureExtractor class for a description of the parameters. method feature_generation (strategy=\"dfs\", n_features=None, operators=None, **kwargs) [source] Generate new features. Create new combinations of existing features to capture the non-linear relations between the original features. See the FeatureGenerator class for a description of the parameters. method feature_grouping (group, name=None, operators=None, drop_columns=True, **kwargs) [source] Extract statistics from similar features. Replace groups of features with related characteristics with new features that summarize statistical properties of te group. The statistical operators are calculated over every row of the group. The group names and features can be accessed through the groups method. See the FeatureGrouper class for a description of the parameters. method feature_selection (strategy=None, solver=None, n_features=None, min_repeated=2, max_repeated=1.0, max_correlation=1.0, **kwargs) [source] Reduce the number of features in the data. Apply feature selection or dimensionality reduction, either to improve the estimators' accuracy or to boost their performance on very high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, remove multicollinear and low variance features. See the FeatureSelector class for a description of the parameters. Note When strategy=\"univariate\" and solver=None, f_classif or f_regression is used as default solver. When strategy is \"sfs\", \"rfecv\" or any of the advanced strategies and no scoring is specified, atom's metric (if it exists) is used as scoring. Training The training methods are where the models are fitted to the data and their performance is evaluated against a selected metric. There are three methods to call the three different training approaches. Read more in the user guide . run Train and evaluate the models in a direct fashion. successive_halving Fit the models in a successive halving fashion. train_sizing Train and evaluate the models in a train sizing fashion. method run (models=None, metric=None, est_params=None, n_trials=0, ht_params=None, n_bootstrap=0, **kwargs) [source] Train and evaluate the models in a direct fashion. Contrary to successive_halving and train_sizing , the direct approach only iterates once over the models, using the full dataset. The following steps are applied to every model: Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional). See the DirectClassifier or DirectRegressor class for a description of the parameters. method successive_halving (models, metric=None, skip_runs=0, est_params=None, n_trials=0, ht_params=None, n_bootstrap=0, **kwargs) [source] Fit the models in a successive halving fashion. The successive halving technique is a bandit-based algorithm that fits N models to 1/N of the data. The best half are selected to go to the next iteration where the process is repeated. This continues until only one model remains, which is fitted on the complete dataset. Beware that a model's performance can depend greatly on the amount of data on which it is trained. For this reason, it is recommended to only use this technique with similar models, e.g. only using tree-based models. The following steps are applied to every model (per iteration): Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional). See the SuccessiveHalvingClassifier or SuccessiveHalvingRegressor class for a description of the parameters. method train_sizing (models, metric=None, train_sizes=5, est_params=None, n_trials=0, ht_params=None, n_bootstrap=0, **kwargs) [source] Train and evaluate the models in a train sizing fashion. When training models, there is usually a trade-off between model performance and computation time, that is regulated by the number of samples in the training set. This method can be used to create insights in this trade-off, and help determine the optimal size of the training set. The models are fitted multiple times, ever-increasing the number of samples in the training set. The following steps are applied to every model (per iteration): Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional).

If the transformer is not fitted, it is fitted on the complete training set. Afterwards, the data set is transformed and the estimator is added to atom's pipeline. If the estimator is a sklearn Pipeline, every estimator is merged independently with atom. Warning The transformer should have fit and/or transform methods with arguments X (accepting a dataframe-like object of shape=(n_samples, n_features)) and/or y (accepting a sequence of shape=(n_samples,)). The transform method should return a feature set as a dataframe-like object of shape=(n_samples, n_features) and/or a target column as a sequence of shape=(n_samples,). Note If the transform method doesn't return a dataframe: The column naming happens as follows. If the transformer has a get_feature_names or get_feature_names_out method, it is used. If not, and it returns the same number of columns, the names are kept equal. If the number of columns change, old columns will keep their name (as long as the column is unchanged) and new columns will receive the name x[N-1] , where N stands for the n-th feature. This means that a transformer should only transform, add or drop columns, not combinations of these. The index remains the same as before the transformation. This means that the transformer should not add, remove or shuffle rows unless it returns a dataframe. Note If the transformer has a n_jobs and/or random_state parameter that is left to its default value, it adopts atom's value. Parameters transformer: Transformer Estimator to add to the pipeline. Should implement a transform method. columns: int, str, slice, sequence or None, default=None Names, indices or dtypes of the columns in the dataset to transform. If None, transform all columns. Add ! in front of a name or dtype to exclude that column, e.g. atom.add(Transformer(), columns=\"!Location\") transforms all columns except Location`. You can either include or exclude columns, not combinations of these. The target column is always included if required by the transformer. train_only: bool, default=False Whether to apply the estimator only on the training set or on the complete dataset. Note that if True, the transformation is skipped when making predictions on new data. **fit_params Additional keyword arguments for the transformer's fit method. method apply (func, inverse_func=None, kw_args=None, inv_kw_args=None, **kwargs) [source] Apply a function to the dataset. The function should have signature func(dataset, **kw_args) -> dataset . This method is useful for stateless transformations such as taking the log, doing custom scaling, etc... Note This approach is preferred over changing the dataset directly through the property's @setter since the transformation is stored in the pipeline. Tip Use atom . apply ( lambda df : df . drop ( \"column_name\" , axis = 1 )) to store the removal of columns in the pipeline. Parameters func: callable Function to apply. inverse_func: callable or None, default=None Inverse function of func . If None, the inverse_transform method returns the input unchanged. kw_args: dict or None, default=None Additional keyword arguments for the function. inv_kw_args: dict or None, default=None Additional keyword arguments for the inverse function. method automl (**kwargs) [source] Search for an optimized pipeline in an automated fashion. Automated machine learning (AutoML) automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning pipelines. Automating the machine learning often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms. ATOM uses the evalML package for AutoML optimization. The resulting transformers and final estimator are merged with atom's pipeline (check the pipeline and models attributes after the method finishes running). The created AutoMLSearch instance can be accessed through the evalml attribute. Warning AutoML algorithms aren't intended to run for only a few minutes. The method may need a very long time to achieve optimal results. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the AutoMLSearch instance. method available_models () [source] Give an overview of the available predefined models. Returns pd.DataFrame Information about the available predefined models . Columns include: acronym: Model's acronym (used to call the model). model: Name of the model's class. estimator: The model's underlying estimator. module: The estimator's module. needs_scaling: Whether the model requires feature scaling. accepts_sparse: Whether the model accepts sparse matrices. native_multioutput: Whether the model has native support for multioutput tasks . has_validation: Whether the model has in-training validation . supports_engines: List of engines supported by the model. method canvas (rows=1, cols=2, horizontal_spacing=0.05, vertical_spacing=0.07, title=None, legend=\"out\", figsize=None, filename=None, display=True) [source] Create a figure with multiple plots. This @contextmanager allows you to draw many plots in one figure. The default option is to add two plots side by side. See the user guide for an example. Parameters rows: int, default=1 Number of plots in length. cols: int, default=2 Number of plots in width. horizontal_spacing: float, default=0.05 Space between subplot rows in normalized plot coordinates.

If dict, title configuration . legend: bool, str or dict, default=\"out\" Legend for the plot. See the user guide for an extended description of the choices. If None: No legend is shown. If str: Location where to show the legend. If dict: Legend configuration. figsize: tuple or None, default=None Figure's size in pixels, format as (x, y). If None, it adapts the size to the number of plots in the canvas. filename: str or None, default=None Save the plot using this name. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. The type of the file depends on the provided name (.html, .png, .pdf, etc...). If filename has no file type, the plot is saved as html. If None, the plot is not saved. display: bool, default=True Whether to render the plot. Yields go.Figure Plot object. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from all models. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method delete (models=None) [source] Delete models. If all models are removed, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving . Deleted models are not removed from any active mlflow experiment . Parameters models: int, str, slice, Model, sequence or None, default=None Models to delete. If None, all models are deleted. method distribution (distributions=None, columns=None) [source] Get statistics on column distributions. Compute the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for various distributions against columns in the dataset. Only for numerical columns. Missing values are ignored. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to plot a column's distribution. Parameters distributions: str, sequence or None, default=None Names of the distributions in scipy.stats to get the statistics on. If None, a selection of the most common ones is used. columns: int, str, slice, sequence or None, default=None Names, positions or dtypes of the columns in the dataset to perform the test on. If None, select all numerical columns. Returns pd.DataFrame Statistic results with multiindex levels: dist: Name of the distribution. stat: Statistic results: score: KS-test score. p_value: Corresponding p-value. method eda (dataset=\"dataset\", n_rows=None, filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an Exploratory Data Analysis report. ATOM uses the pandas-profiling package for the EDA. The report is rendered directly in the notebook. The created ProfileReport instance can be accessed through the report attribute. Warning This method can be slow for large datasets. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"dataset\" Data set to get the report from. n_rows: int or None, default=None Number of (randomly picked) rows to process. None to use all rows. filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ProfileReport instance. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get all models' scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metric to calculate. If None, it returns an overview of the most common metrics per task. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.DataFrame Scores of the models. method export_pipeline (model=None, memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the pipeline to a sklearn-like object. Optionally, you can add a model as final estimator. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters model: str, Model or None, default=None Model for which to export the pipeline. If the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. If None, the pipeline in the current branch is exported. memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Sklearn-like Pipeline object with all transformers in the current branch. method get_class_weight (dataset=\"train\", target=0) [source] Return class weights for a balanced dataset. Statistically, the class weights re-balance the data set so that the sampled data set represents the target population as closely as possible. The returned weights are inversely proportional to the class frequencies in the selected data set. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"train\" Data set from which to get the weights. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"dataset\". target: int or str, default=0 Target column to get the class weights from. Only for multioutput tasks . Returns dict Classes with the corresponding weights. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method.

Use the parameters to choose which transformations to perform. The available steps are: Drop columns with specific data types. Strip categorical features from white spaces. Drop duplicate rows. Drop rows with missing values in the target column. Encode the target column (ignored for regression tasks). See the Cleaner class for a description of the parameters. method discretize (strategy=\"quantile\", bins=5, labels=None, **kwargs) [source] Bin continuous data into intervals. For each feature, the bin edges are computed during fit and, together with the number of bins, they will define the intervals. Ignores numerical columns. See the Discretizer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to visualize a column's distribution and decide on the bins. method encode (strategy=\"LeaveOneOut\", max_onehot=10, ordinal=None, rare_to_value=None, value=\"rare\", **kwargs) [source] Perform encoding of categorical features. The encoding type depends on the number of classes in the column: If n_classes=2 or ordinal feature, use Ordinal-encoding. If 2 < n_classes <= max_onehot , use OneHot-encoding. If n_classes > max_onehot , use strategy -encoding. Missing values are propagated to the output column. Unknown classes encountered during transforming are imputed according to the selected strategy. Rare classes can be replaced with a value in order to prevent too high cardinality. See the Encoder class for a description of the parameters. Note This method only encodes the categorical features. It does not encode the target column! Use the clean method for that.

Impute or remove missing values according to the selected strategy. Also removes rows and columns with too many missing values. Use the missing attribute to customize what are considered \"missing values\". See the Imputer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the nans attribute to check the amount of missing values per column. method normalize (strategy=\"yeojohnson\", **kwargs) [source] Transform the data to follow a Normal/Gaussian distribution. This transformation is useful for modeling issues related to heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance), or other situations where normality is desired. Missing values are disregarded in fit and maintained in transform. Ignores categorical columns. See the Normalizer class for a description of the parameters. Tip Use the plot_distribution method to examine a column's distribution. method prune (strategy=\"zscore\", method=\"drop\", max_sigma=3, include_target=False, **kwargs) [source] Prune outliers from the training set. Replace or remove outliers. The definition of outlier depends on the selected strategy and can greatly differ from one another. Ignores categorical columns.

Contrary to successive_halving and train_sizing , the direct approach only iterates once over the models, using the full dataset. The following steps are applied to every model: Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional). See the DirectClassifier or DirectRegressor class for a description of the parameters. method successive_halving (models, metric=None, skip_runs=0, est_params=None, n_trials=0, ht_params=None, n_bootstrap=0, **kwargs) [source] Fit the models in a successive halving fashion. The successive halving technique is a bandit-based algorithm that fits N models to 1/N of the data. The best half are selected to go to the next iteration where the process is repeated. This continues until only one model remains, which is fitted on the complete dataset. Beware that a model's performance can depend greatly on the amount of data on which it is trained. For this reason, it is recommended to only use this technique with similar models, e.g. only using tree-based models. The following steps are applied to every model (per iteration): Apply hyperparameter tuning (optional). Fit the model on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. Evaluate the model on the test set. Train the estimator on various bootstrapped samples of the training set and evaluate again on the test set (optional).

When training models, there is usually a trade-off between model performance and computation time, that is regulated by the number of samples in the training set. This method can be used to create insights in this trade-off, and help determine the optimal size of the training set.

Rare classes can be replaced with a value in order to prevent too high cardinality. This class can be accessed from atom through the encode method. Read more in the user guide . Warning Two category-encoders estimators are unavailable: OneHotEncoder : Use the max_onehot parameter. HashingEncoder : Incompatibility of APIs. Parameters strategy: str or estimator, default=\"LeaveOneOut\" Type of encoding to use for high cardinality features. Choose from any of the estimators in the category-encoders package or provide a custom one. max_onehot: int or None, default=10 Maximum number of unique values in a feature to perform one-hot encoding. If None, strategy -encoding is always used for columns with more than two classes. ordinal: dict or None, default=None Order of ordinal features, where the dict key is the feature's name and the value is the class order, e.g. {\"salary\": [\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"]} . rare_to_value: int, float or None, default=None Replaces rare class occurrences in categorical columns with the string in parameter value . This transformation is done before the encoding of the column. If None: Skip this step. If int: Minimum number of occurrences in a class. If float: Minimum fraction of occurrences in a class. value: str, default=\"rare\" Value with which to replace rare classes. This parameter is ignored if rare_to_value=None . verbose: int, default=0 Verbosity level of the class. Choose from: 0 to not print anything. 1 to print basic information. 2 to print detailed information. logger: str, Logger or None, default=None If None: Doesn't save a logging file. If str: Name of the log file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. Else: Python logging.Logger instance. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the strategy estimator. Attributes mapping: dict of dicts Encoded values and their respective mapping. The column name is the key to its mapping dictionary. Only for columns mapped to a single column (e.g. Ordinal, Leave-one-out, etc...). feature_names_in_: np.array Names of features seen during fit. n_features_in_: int Number of features seen during fit.

Apply feature selection or dimensionality reduction, either to improve the estimators' accuracy or to boost their performance on very high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, remove multicollinear and low variance features. This class can be accessed from atom through the feature_selection method. Read more in the user guide . Warning Ties between features with equal scores are broken in an unspecified way. For strategy=\"rfecv\", the n_features parameter is the minimum number of features to select, not the actual number of features that the transformer returns. It may very well be that it returns more! Info The \"sklearnex\" and \"cuml\" engines are only supported for strategy=\"pca\" with dense datasets. If strategy=\"pca\" and the data is dense and unscaled, it's scaled to mean=0 and std=1 before fitting the PCA transformer. If strategy=\"pca\" and the provided data is sparse, the used estimator is TruncatedSVD , which works more efficiently with sparse matrices. Tip Use the plot_feature_importance method to examine how much a specific feature contributes to the final predictions.

Choose from: If strategy=\"univariate\": \" f_classif \" \" f_regression \" \" mutual_info_classif \" \" mutual_info_regression \" \" chi2 \" Any function with signature func(X, y) -> (scores, p-values) . If strategy=\"pca\": If data is dense: If engine=\"sklearn\": \"auto\" (default) \"full\" \"arpack\" \"randomized\" If engine=\"sklearnex\": \"full\" (default) If engine=\"cuml\": \"full\" (default) \"jacobi\" If data is sparse: \"randomized\" (default) \"arpack\" for the remaining strategies: The base estimator. For sfm, rfe and rfecv, it should have either a feature_importances_ or coef_ attribute after fitting. You can use one of the predefined models .

This parameter is ignored if any of the following strategies is selected: pso, hho, gwo, dfo, go. min_repeated: int, float or None, default=2 Remove categorical features if there isn't any repeated value in at least min_repeated rows. The default is to keep all features with non-maximum variance, i.e. remove the features which number of unique values is equal to the number of rows (usually the case for names, IDs, etc...). If None: No check for minimum repetition. If >1: Minimum repetition number. If <=1: Minimum repetition fraction. max_repeated: int, float or None, default=1.0 Remove categorical features with the same value in at least max_repeated rows. The default is to keep all features with non-zero variance, i.e. remove the features that have the same value in all samples. If None: No check for maximum repetition. If >1: Maximum number of repeated occurences. If <=1: Maximum fraction of repeated occurences. max_correlation: float or None, default=1.0 Minimum absolute Pearson correlation to identify correlated features. For each group, it removes all except the feature with the highest correlation to y (if provided, else it removes all but the first). The default value removes equal columns. If None, skip this step. n_jobs: int, default=1 Number of cores to use for parallel processing. If >0: Number of cores to use. If -1: Use all available cores. If <-1: Use number of cores - 1 + n_jobs . device: str, default=\"cpu\" Device on which to train the estimators.

FeatureSelector (strategy=None, solver=None, n_features=None, min_repeated=2, max_repeated=1.0, max_correlation=1.0, n_jobs=1, device=\"cpu\", engine=\"sklearn\", verbose=0, logger=None, random_state=None, **kwargs) [source] Reduce the number of features in the data. Apply feature selection or dimensionality reduction, either to improve the estimators' accuracy or to boost their performance on very high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, remove multicollinear and low variance features. This class can be accessed from atom through the feature_selection method. Read more in the user guide . Warning Ties between features with equal scores are broken in an unspecified way. For strategy=\"rfecv\", the n_features parameter is the minimum number of features to select, not the actual number of features that the transformer returns. It may very well be that it returns more! Info The \"sklearnex\" and \"cuml\" engines are only supported for strategy=\"pca\" with dense datasets. If strategy=\"pca\" and the data is dense and unscaled, it's scaled to mean=0 and std=1 before fitting the PCA transformer. If strategy=\"pca\" and the provided data is sparse, the used estimator is TruncatedSVD , which works more efficiently with sparse matrices. Tip Use the plot_feature_importance method to examine how much a specific feature contributes to the final predictions. If the model doesn't have a feature_importances_ attribute, use plot_permutation_importance instead. Parameters strategy: str or None, default=None Feature selection strategy to use. Choose from: None: Do not perform any feature selection strategy. \" univariate \": Univariate statistical F-test. \" pca \": Principal Component Analysis. \" sfm \": Select best features according to a model. \" sfs \": Sequential Feature Selection. \" rfe \": Recursive Feature Elimination. \" rfecv \": RFE with cross-validated selection. \" pso \": Particle Swarm Optimization. \" hho \": Harris Hawks Optimization. \" gwo \": Grey Wolf Optimization. \" dfo \": Dragonfly Optimization. \" go \": Genetic Optimization. solver: str, estimator or None, default=None Solver/estimator to use for the feature selection strategy.

Choose from: If strategy=\"univariate\": \" f_classif \" \" f_regression \" \" mutual_info_classif \" \" mutual_info_regression \" \" chi2 \" Any function with signature func(X, y) -> (scores, p-values) . If strategy=\"pca\": If data is dense: If engine=\"sklearn\": \"auto\" (default) \"full\" \"arpack\" \"randomized\" If engine=\"sklearnex\": \"full\" (default) If engine=\"cuml\": \"full\" (default) \"jacobi\" If data is sparse: \"randomized\" (default) \"arpack\" for the remaining strategies: The base estimator. For sfm, rfe and rfecv, it should have either a feature_importances_ or coef_ attribute after fitting. You can use one of the predefined models .

No default option. n_features: int, float or None, default=None Number of features to select. If None: Select all features. If <1: Fraction of the total features to select. If >=1: Number of features to select. If strategy=\"sfm\" and the threshold parameter is not specified, the threshold is automatically set to -inf to select n_features number of features.

This parameter is ignored if any of the following strategies is selected: pso, hho, gwo, dfo, go. min_repeated: int, float or None, default=2 Remove categorical features if there isn't any repeated value in at least min_repeated rows. The default is to keep all features with non-maximum variance, i.e. remove the features which number of unique values is equal to the number of rows (usually the case for names, IDs, etc...). If None: No check for minimum repetition. If >1: Minimum repetition number. If <=1: Minimum repetition fraction. max_repeated: int, float or None, default=1.0 Remove categorical features with the same value in at least max_repeated rows. The default is to keep all features with non-zero variance, i.e. remove the features that have the same value in all samples. If None: No check for maximum repetition. If >1: Maximum number of repeated occurences. If <=1: Maximum fraction of repeated occurences. max_correlation: float or None, default=1.0 Minimum absolute Pearson correlation to identify correlated features. For each group, it removes all except the feature with the highest correlation to y (if provided, else it removes all but the first). The default value removes equal columns. If None, skip this step. n_jobs: int, default=1 Number of cores to use for parallel processing. If >0: Number of cores to use. If -1: Use all available cores. If <-1: Use number of cores - 1 + n_jobs . device: str, default=\"cpu\" Device on which to train the estimators.

Take bootstrapped samples from the training set and test them on the test set to get a distribution of the model's results. Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Take bootstrapped samples from the training set and test them on the test set to get a distribution of the model's results. Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter.

The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method.

If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from.

Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set.

Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method.

If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter.

Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Transformed feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Transformed target column.

The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter.

Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows.

The remaining utility methods can be found hereunder. bootstrapping Apply a bootstrap algorithm. calibrate Calibrate the model. clear Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. create_app Create an interactive app to test model predictions. create_dashboard Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. cross_validate Evaluate the model using cross-validation. delete Delete the model. evaluate Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. export_pipeline Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. fit Fit and validate the model. full_train Train the estimator on the complete dataset. hyperparameter_tuning Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. inverse_transform Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. save_estimator Save the estimator to a pickle file. register Register the model in mlflow's model registry . transform Transform new data through the pipeline. method bootstrapping (n_bootstrap, reset=False) [source] Apply a bootstrap algorithm. Take bootstrapped samples from the training set and test them on the test set to get a distribution of the model's results. Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Transformed feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Transformed target column.

Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Transformed feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Transformed target column.

Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

In each stage n_classes_ regression trees are fit on the negative gradient of the loss function, e.g. binary or multiclass log loss. Binary classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is induced. Corresponding estimators are: GradientBoostingClassifier for classification tasks. GradientBoostingRegressor for regression tasks. Read more in sklearn's documentation .

Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from.

None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model.

Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter.

The advantages of Gaussian processes are: The prediction interpolates the observations. The prediction is probabilistic (Gaussian) so that one can compute empirical confidence intervals and decide based on those if one should refit (online fitting, adaptive fitting) the prediction in some region of interest. The disadvantages of Gaussian processes include: They are not sparse, i.e. they use the whole samples/features information to perform the prediction. They lose efficiency in high dimensional spaces, namely when the number of features exceeds a few dozens. Corresponding estimators are: GaussianProcessClassifier for classification tasks.

Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well.

If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method.

If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions.

The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html).

This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate.

Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization.

It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well.

Take bootstrapped samples from the training set and test them on the test set to get a distribution of the model's results. Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features).

ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance.

Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter.

Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well.

Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization.

Take bootstrapped samples from the training set and test them on the test set to get a distribution of the model's results. Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Transformed feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Transformed target column.

Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter.

Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method.

Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline.

Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Transformed feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Transformed target column.

The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter.

ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter.

Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization.

The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization.

Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Methods The plots and prediction methods can be called directly from the model. The remaining utility methods can be found hereunder. bootstrapping Apply a bootstrap algorithm. calibrate Calibrate the model. clear Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. create_app Create an interactive app to test model predictions. create_dashboard Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. cross_validate Evaluate the model using cross-validation. delete Delete the model. evaluate Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. export_pipeline Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. fit Fit and validate the model. full_train Train the estimator on the complete dataset. hyperparameter_tuning Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. inverse_transform Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. save_estimator Save the estimator to a pickle file. register Register the model in mlflow's model registry . transform Transform new data through the pipeline. method bootstrapping (n_bootstrap, reset=False) [source] Apply a bootstrap algorithm. Take bootstrapped samples from the training set and test them on the test set to get a distribution of the model's results. Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Transformed feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Transformed target column.

The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter.

The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm.

If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored.

Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from.

Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X.

Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

The remaining utility methods can be found hereunder. bootstrapping Apply a bootstrap algorithm. calibrate Calibrate the model. clear Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. create_app Create an interactive app to test model predictions. create_dashboard Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. cross_validate Evaluate the model using cross-validation. delete Delete the model. evaluate Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. export_pipeline Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. fit Fit and validate the model. full_train Train the estimator on the complete dataset. hyperparameter_tuning Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. inverse_transform Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. save_estimator Save the estimator to a pickle file. register Register the model in mlflow's model registry . transform Transform new data through the pipeline. method bootstrapping (n_bootstrap, reset=False) [source] Apply a bootstrap algorithm. Take bootstrapped samples from the training set and test them on the test set to get a distribution of the model's results. Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter.

Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter.

The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline.

To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm.

Take bootstrapped samples from the training set and test them on the test set to get a distribution of the model's results. Parameters n_bootstrap: int umber of bootstrapped samples to fit on. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new run or continue the existing one. method calibrate (**kwargs) [source] Calibrate the model. Applies probability calibration on the model. The estimator is trained via cross-validation on a subset of the training data, using the rest to fit the calibrator. The new classifier will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started using the name [model_name]_calibrate . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Only for classifiers. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's CCV. Using cv=\"prefit\" will use the trained model and fit the calibrator on the test set. Use this only if you have another, independent set for testing. method clear () [source] Reset attributes and clear cache from the model. Reset certain model attributes to their initial state, deleting potentially large data arrays. Use this method to free some memory before saving the instance. The affected attributes are: In-training validation scores Shap values App instance Dashboard instance Cached prediction attributes Cached metric scores Cached holdout data sets method create_app (**kwargs) [source] Create an interactive app to test model predictions. Demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface. This app launches directly in the notebook or on an external browser page. The created Interface instance can be accessed through the app attribute. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the Interface instance or the Interface.launch method. method create_dashboard (dataset=\"test\", filename=None, **kwargs) [source] Create an interactive dashboard to analyze the model. ATOM uses the explainerdashboard package to provide a quick and easy way to analyze and explain the predictions and workings of the model. The dashboard allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees. By default, the dashboard renders in a new tab in your default browser, but if preferable, you can render it inside the notebook using the mode=\"inline\" parameter. The created ExplainerDashboard instance can be accessed through the dashboard attribute. Note Plots displayed by the dashboard are not created by ATOM and can differ from those retrieved through this package. Parameters dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set to get the report from. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\", \"both\" (train and test) or \"holdout\". filename: str or None, default=None Name to save the file with (as .html). None to not save anything. **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for the ExplainerDashboard instance. method cross_validate (**kwargs) [source] Evaluate the model using cross-validation. This method cross-validates the whole pipeline on the complete dataset. Use it to assess the robustness of the solution's performance. Parameters **kwargs Additional keyword arguments for sklearn's cross_validate function. If the scoring method is not specified, it uses atom's metric. Returns pd.DataFrame Overview of the results. method delete () [source] Delete the model. If it's the last model in atom, the metric is reset. Use this method to drop unwanted models from the pipeline or to free some memory before saving. The model is not removed from any active mlflow experiment. method evaluate (metric=None, dataset=\"test\", threshold=0.5, sample_weight=None) [source] Get the model's scores for the provided metrics. Parameters metric: str, func, scorer, sequence or None, default=None Metrics to calculate. If None, a selection of the most common metrics per task are used. dataset: str, default=\"test\" Data set on which to calculate the metric. Choose from: \"train\", \"test\" or \"holdout\". threshold: float, default=0.5 Threshold between 0 and 1 to convert predicted probabilities to class labels. Only used when: The task is binary classification. The model has a predict_proba method. The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Transformed feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Transformed target column.

The metric evaluates predicted target values. sample_weight: sequence or None, default=None Sample weights corresponding to y in dataset . Returns pd.Series Scores of the model. method export_pipeline (memory=None, verbose=None) [source] Export the model's pipeline to a sklearn-like object. The returned pipeline is already fitted on the training set. Note that, if the model used automated feature scaling , the Scaler is added to the pipeline. Info The returned pipeline behaves similarly to sklearn's Pipeline , and additionally: Accepts transformers that change the target column. Accepts transformers that drop rows. Accepts transformers that only are fitted on a subset of the provided dataset. Always returns pandas objects. Uses transformers that are only applied on the training set to fit the pipeline, not to make predictions. Parameters memory: bool, str, Memory or None, default=None Used to cache the fitted transformers of the pipeline. - If None or False: No caching is performed. - If True: A default temp directory is used. - If str: Path to the caching directory. - If Memory: Object with the joblib.Memory interface. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level of the transformers in the pipeline. If None, it leaves them to their original verbosity. Note that this is not the pipeline's own verbose parameter. To change that, use the set_params method. Returns Pipeline Current branch as a sklearn-like Pipeline object. method fit (X=None, y=None) [source] Fit and validate the model. The estimator is fitted using the best hyperparameters found during hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, the estimator is evaluated on the test set. Only use this method to re-fit the model after having continued the study. Parameters X: pd.DataFrame or None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, self.X_train is used. y: pd.Series or None Target column corresponding to X. If None, self.y_train is used. method full_train (include_holdout=False) [source] Train the estimator on the complete dataset. In some cases it might be desirable to use all available data to train a final model. Note that doing this means that the estimator can no longer be evaluated on the test set. The newly retrained estimator will replace the estimator attribute. If there is an active mlflow experiment, a new run is started with the name [model_name]_full_train . Since the estimator changed, the model is cleared. Warning Although the model is trained on the complete dataset, the pipeline is not. To get a fully trained pipeline, use: pipeline = atom.export_pipeline().fit(atom.X, atom.y) . Parameters include_holdout: bool, default=False Whether to include the holdout set (if available) in the training of the estimator. It's discouraged to use this option since it means the model can no longer be evaluated on any set. method hyperparameter_tuning (n_trials, reset=False) [source] Run the hyperparameter tuning algorithm. Search for the best combination of hyperparameters. The function to optimize is evaluated either with a K-fold cross-validation on the training set or using a random train and validation split every trial. Use this method to continue the optimization. Parameters n_trials: int Number of trials for the hyperparameter tuning. reset: bool, default=False Whether to start a new study or continue the existing one. method inverse_transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Inversely transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. The rest should all implement a inverse_transform method. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, inversely transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the scaling is inversed as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Transformed feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers. If None, it uses the transformer's own verbosity. Returns pd.DataFrame Original feature set. Only returned if provided. y: pd.Series Original target column. Only returned if provided. method save_estimator (filename=\"auto\") [source] Save the estimator to a pickle file. Parameters filename: str, default=\"auto\" Name of the file. Use \"auto\" for automatic naming. method register (name=None, stage=\"Staging\") [source] Register the model in mlflow's model registry . This method is only available when model tracking is enabled using one of the following URI schemes: databricks, http, https, postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mssql. Parameters name: str or None, default=None Name for the registered model. If None, the model's full name is used. stage: str, default=\"Staging\" New desired stage for the model. method transform (X=None, y=None, verbose=None) [source] Transform new data through the pipeline. Transformers that are only applied on the training set are skipped. If only X or only y is provided, it ignores transformers that require the other parameter. This can be of use to, for example, transform only the target column. If called from a model that used automated feature scaling, the data is scaled as well. Parameters X: dataframe-like or None, default=None Feature set with shape=(n_samples, n_features). If None, X is ignored. If None, X is ignored in the transformers. y: int, str, dict, sequence or None, default=None If None: y is ignored in the transformers. If int: Position of the target column in X. If str: Name of the target column in X. Else: Array with shape=(n_samples,) to use as target. verbose: int or None, default=None Verbosity level for the transformers.

If strategy=\"hashing\", the columns are named hash[N], where N stands for the n-th hashed column. This class can be accessed from atom through the vectorize method. Read more in the user guide . Parameters strategy: str, default=\"bow\" Strategy with which to vectorize the text. Choose from: \" bow \": Bag of Words. \" tfidf \": Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency. \" hashing \": Vectorize to a matrix of token occurrences. return_sparse: bool, default=True Whether to return the transformation output as a dataframe of sparse arrays. Must be False when there are other columns in X (besides corpus ) that are non-sparse. device: str, default=\"cpu\" Device on which to train the estimators. Use any string that follows the SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER filter selector, e.g. device=\"gpu\" to use the GPU. Read more in the user guide . engine: str, default=\"sklearn\" Execution engine to use for the estimators. Refer to the user guide for an explanation regarding every choice. Choose from: \"sklearn\" (only if device=\"cpu\") \"cuml\" (only if device=\"gpu\") verbose: int, default=0 Verbosity level of the class. Choose from: 0 to not print anything. 1 to print basic information. 2 to print detailed information. logger: str, Logger or None, default=None If None: Doesn't save a logging file.

Usually, this involves importing different libraries and writing many lines of code. Since ATOM is all about fast exploration and experimentation, it provides various data cleaning classes to apply the most common transformations fast and easy. Note All of atom's data cleaning methods automatically adopt the relevant transformer attributes ( n_jobs , verbose , logger , random_state ) from atom. A different choice can be added as parameter to the method call, e.g. atom . scale ( verbose = 2 ) . Note Like the add method, the data cleaning methods accept the columns parameter to only transform a subset of the dataset's features, e.g. atom . scale ( columns = [ 0 , 1 ]) . Balancing the data One of the common issues found in datasets that are used for classification is imbalanced classes. Data imbalance usually reflects an unequal distribution of classes within a dataset. For example, in a credit card fraud detection dataset, most of the transactions are non-fraud, and a very few cases are fraud. This leaves us with a very unbalanced ratio of fraud vs non-fraud cases. The Balancer class can oversample the minority class or undersample the majority class using any of the transformers implemented in the imblearn package. It can be accessed from atom through the balance method. Standard data cleaning There are many data cleaning steps that are useful to perform on any dataset before modelling. These are general rules that apply almost on every use-case and every task. The Cleaner class is a convenient tool to apply such steps. It can be accessed from atom through the clean method. Use the class' parameters to choose which transformations to perform. The available steps are: Drop columns with specific data types. Strip categorical features from white spaces. Drop duplicate rows. Drop rows with missing values in the target column. Encode the target column. Binning numerical features Discretization (otherwise known as quantization or binning) provides a way to partition continuous features into discrete values. Certain datasets with continuous features may benefit from discretization, because discretization can transform the dataset of continuous attributes to one with only nominal attributes. Discretization is similar to constructing histograms for continuous data. However, histograms focus on counting features which fall into particular bins, whereas discretization focuses on assigning feature values to these bins. The Discretizer class can be used to bin continuous data into intervals. It can be accessed from atom through the discretize method. Encoding categorical features Many datasets contain categorical features. Their variables are typically stored as text values which represent various classes. Some examples include color (\u201cRed\u201d, \u201cYellow\u201d, \u201cBlue\u201d), size (\u201cSmall\u201d, \u201cMedium\u201d, \u201cLarge\u201d) or geographic designations (city or country). Regardless of what the value is used for, the challenge is determining how to use this data in the analysis. The majority of sklearn's models don't support direct manipulation of this kind of data. Use the Encoder class to encode categorical features to numerical values. It can be accessed from atom through the encode method. There are many strategies to encode categorical columns. The Encoder class applies one strategy or another depending on the number of classes in the column to be encoded. When there are only two, the values are encoded with 0 or 1. When there are more than two, the columns can be encoded using one-hot encoding or any other strategy of the category-encoders package, depending on the value of the max_onehot parameter. One-hot encodes the column making a dummy feature for every class. This approach preserves all the information but increases the size of the dataset considerably, making it often an undesirable strategy for high cardinality features. Other strategies like LeaveOneOut transform the column in place. Imputing missing values For various reasons, many real world datasets contain missing values, often encoded as blanks, NaNs or other placeholders. Such datasets however are incompatible with ATOM's models which assume that all values in an array are numerical, and that all have and hold meaning. The Imputer class handles missing values in the dataset by either dropping or imputing the value. It can be accessed from atom through the impute method. Normalizing the feature set Use the Normalizer class to transform the feature set to follow a Normal (Gaussian)-like distribution. In general, data must be transformed when using models that assume normality in the residuals. Examples of such models are LogisticRegression , LinearDiscriminantAnalysis and GaussianNB . The class can be accessed from atom through the normalize method. Handling outliers When modelling, it is important to clean the data sample to ensure that the observations best represent the problem. Sometimes a dataset can contain extreme values that are outside the range of what is expected and unlike the other data. These are called outliers. Often, machine learning modelling and model skill in general can be improved by understanding and even removing these outlier samples. The Pruner class offers 7 different strategies to detect outliers (described hereunder). It can be accessed from atom through the prune method. z-score The z-score of a value in the dataset is defined as the number of standard deviations by which the value is above or below the mean of the column. Values above or below a certain threshold (specified with the parameter max_sigma ) are considered outliers. Note that, contrary to the rest of the strategies, this approach selects outlier values, not outlier samples! Because of this, it is possible to replace the outlier value instead of dropping the entire sample. Isolation Forest Uses a tree-based anomaly detection algorithm. It is based on modeling the normal data in such a way as to isolate anomalies that are both few and different in the feature space. Read more in sklearn's documentation . Elliptic Envelope If the input variables have a Gaussian distribution, then simple statistical methods can be used to detect outliers. For example, if the dataset has two input variables and both are Gaussian, the feature space forms a multidimensional Gaussian, and knowledge of this distribution can be used to identify values far from the distribution. This approach can be generalized by defining a hypersphere (ellipsoid) that covers the normal data, and data that falls outside this shape is considered an outlier. Read more in sklearn's documentation . Local Outlier Factor A simple approach to identifying outliers is to locate those examples that are far from the other examples in the feature space. This can work well for feature spaces with low dimensionality (few features) but becomes less reliable as the number of features is increased. The local outlier factor is a technique that attempts to harness the idea of nearest neighbors for outlier detection. Each example is assigned a score of how isolated or how likely it is to be outliers based on the size of its local neighborhood. Those examples with the largest score are more likely to be outliers. Read more in sklearn's documentation . One-class SVM The support vector machine algorithm, initially developed for binary classification tasks, can also be used for one-class classification. When modeling one class, the algorithm captures the density of the majority class and classifies examples on the extremes of the density function as outliers. This modification of SVM is referred to as One-Class SVM. Read more in sklearn's documentation . DBSCAN The DBSCAN algorithm views clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density. Due to this rather generic view, clusters found by DBSCAN can be any shape, as opposed to k-means which assumes that clusters are convex shaped. Samples that lie outside any cluster are considered outliers. Read more in sklearn's documentation . OPTICS The OPTICS algorithm shares many similarities with the DBSCAN algorithm, and can be considered a generalization of DBSCAN that relaxes the eps requirement from a single value to a value range. The key difference between DBSCAN and OPTICS is that the OPTICS algorithm builds a reachability graph, and a spot within the cluster ordering. These two attributes are assigned when the model is fitted, and are used to determine cluster membership. Read more in sklearn's documentation . Scaling the feature set Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators; they might behave badly if the individual features do not more or less look like standard normally distributed data (e.g. Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance).

Use the Encoder class to encode categorical features to numerical values. It can be accessed from atom through the encode method. There are many strategies to encode categorical columns. The Encoder class applies one strategy or another depending on the number of classes in the column to be encoded. When there are only two, the values are encoded with 0 or 1. When there are more than two, the columns can be encoded using one-hot encoding or any other strategy of the category-encoders package, depending on the value of the max_onehot parameter.

This is the dataset you want to explore, transform, and use for model training and validation. ATOM differentiates three different data sets: The training set is usually the largest of the data sets. As the name suggests, this set is used to train the pipeline. During hyperparameter tuning , only the training set is used to fit and evaluate the estimator in every call. The training set in the current branch can be accessed through the train attribute. It's features and target can be accessed through X_train and y_train respectively. The test set is used to evaluate the models. The model scores on this set give an indication on how the model performs on new data. The test set can be accessed through the test attribute. It's features and target can be accessed through X_test and y_test respectively. The holdout set is an optional, separate set that should only be used to evaluate the final model's performance. Create this set when you are going to use the test set for an intermediate validation step. The holdout set is immediately set apart during initialization and is not considered part of atom's dataset (the dataset attribute only returns the train and test sets). The holdout set is left untouched until predictions are made on it, i.e. it does not undergo any pipeline transformations. The holdout set is stored in atom's holdout attribute. It's features and target can not be accessed separately. See here an example that shows how to use the holdout data set. The data can be provided in different formats. If the data sets are not specified beforehand, you can input the features and target separately or together: X X, y Remember to use the y parameter to indicate the target column in X when using the first option. If not specified, the last column in X is used as target. In both these cases, the size of the sets are defined using the test_size and holdout_size parameters. Note that the splits are made after the subsample of the dataset with the n_rows parameter (when not left to its default value). If you already have the separate data sets, provide them using one of the following formats: train, test train, test, holdout X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test X_train, X_test, X_holdout, y_train, y_test, y_holdout (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test), (X_holdout, y_holdout) The input data is always converted internally to a pandas dataframe , if it isn't one already. The column names should always be strings. If they are not, atom changes their type at initialization. If no column names are provided, default names are given of the form X[N-1] , where N stands for the n-th feature in the dataset. Indexing By default, atom resets the dataframe's index after initialization and after every transformation in the pipeline. To avoid this, specify the index parameter. If the dataset has an 'identifier' column, it is useful to use it as index for two reasons: An identifier doesn't usually contain any useful information on the target column, and should therefore be removed before training. Predictions of specific rows can be accessed through their index. Warning Avoid duplicate indices in the dataframe. Having them may potentially lead to unexpected behavior. Sparse datasets If atom is initialized using a scipy sparse matrix, it is converted internally to a dataframe of sparse columns. Read more about pandas' sparse data structures here . The same conversion takes place when a transformer returns a sparse matrix, like for example, the Vectorizer . Note that ATOM considers a dataset to be sparse if any of the columns is sparse. A dataset can only benefit from sparsity when all its columns are sparse, hence mixing sparse and non-sparse columns is not recommended and can cause estimators to decrease their training speed or even crash. Use the shrink method to convert dense features to sparse and the available_models method to check which models have native support for sparse matrices. Click here to see an example that uses sparse data. Multioutput tasks Multioutput is a task where there are more than one target column, i.e. the goal is to predict multiple targets at the same time. When providing a dataframe as target, use the y parameter. Providing y without keyword makes ATOM think you are providing train, test (see the data sets section). Task types ATOM recognizes three multioutput tasks. Note Combinations of binary and multiclass target columns are treated as multiclass-multioutput tasks. Multilabel Multilabel multioutput is a classification task, labeling each sample with m labels from n_classes possible classes, where m can be 0 to n_classes inclusive. This can be thought of as predicting properties of a sample that are not mutually exclusive. For example, prediction of the topics relevant to a text document. The document may be about one of religion, politics, finance or education, several of the topic classes or all of the topic classes. The target column ( atom.y ) could look like this: 0 [politics] 1 [religion, finance] 2 [politics, finance, education] 3 [] 4 [finance] 5 [finance, religion] 6 [finance] 7 [religion, finance] 8 [education] 9 [finance, religion, politics] Name: target, dtype: object A model can not directly ingest a variable amount of target classes. Use the clean method to assign a binary output to each class, for every sample. Positive classes are indicated with 1 and negative classes with 0. It is thus comparable to running n_classes binary classification tasks. In our example, target ( atom.y ) is converted to: education finance politics religion 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 2 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 5 0 1 0 1 6 0 1 0 0 7 0 1 0 1 8 1 0 0 0 9 0 1 1 1 Multiclass-multioutput Multiclass-multioutput (also known as multitask classification) is a classification task which labels each sample with a set of non-binary properties. Both the number of properties and the number of classes per property is greater than 2. A single estimator thus handles several joint classification tasks. This is both a generalization of the multilabel classification task, which only considers binary attributes, as well as a generalization of the multiclass classification task, where only one property is considered. For example, classification of the properties \"type of fruit\" and \"colour\" for a set of images of fruit. The property \"type of fruit\" has the possible classes: \"apple\", \"pear\" and \"orange\". The property \"colour\" has the possible classes: \"green\", \"red\", \"yellow\" and \"orange\". Each sample is an image of a fruit, a label is output for both properties and each label is one of the possible classes of the corresponding property. Multioutput regression Multioutput regression predicts multiple numerical properties for each sample. Each property is a numerical variable and the number of properties to be predicted for each sample is >= 2. Some estimators that support multioutput regression are faster than just running n_output estimators. For example, prediction of both wind speed and wind direction, in degrees, using data obtained at a certain location. Each sample would be data obtained at one location and both wind speed and direction would be output for each sample. Native multioutput models Some models have native support for multioutput tasks. This means that the original estimator is used to make predictions directly on all the target columns. Examples of such models are KNearestNeighbors , RandomForest and ExtraTrees . Non-native multioutput models The majority of the models don't have integrated support for multioutput tasks. However, it's possible to still use them for such tasks, wrapping them in a meta-estimator capable of handling multiple target columns. For non-native multioutput models, ATOM does so automatically. For multilabel tasks, the meta-estimator is: ClassifierChain RegressorChain And for multiclass-multioutput and multioutput regression , the meta-estimator is: MultioutputClassifier MultioutputRegressor The multioutput attribute contains the meta-estimator object. Change the attribute's value to use a custom object. Both classes or instances where the underlying estimator is the first parameter are accepted. Set the attribute to None to ignore the meta-estimator for multioutput tasks. Note Currently, scikit-learn metrics do not support multiple target variables. If the prediction method needed to calculate a metric returns multiple columns, ATOM calculates the mean of the selected metric over every individual target. Tip Some models like MultiLayerPerceptron have native support for multilabel tasks, but not for multioutput. Use atom.multioutput = None to disable the meta-estimator wrapper. Set the native_multioutput parameter in ATOMModel equal to True to ignore the meta-estimator for custom models . Branches You might want to compare how a model performs on a dataset transformed through multiple pipelines, each using different transformers. For example, on one pipeline with an undersampling strategy and the other with an oversampling strategy. To be able to do this, ATOM has the branching system. The branching system helps the user to manage multiple data pipelines within the same atom instance. Branches are created and accessed through atom's branch property. A branch contains a specific pipeline, the dataset transformed through that pipeline, and all data and utility attributes that refer to that dataset. Transformers and models called from atom use the dataset in the current branch, as well as data attributes such as atom.dataset . Use the branch's __repr__ to get an overview of the transformers in the branch. It's not allowed to change the data in a branch after fitting a model with it. Doing this would cause unexpected model behaviour and break down the plotting methods. Instead, create a new branch for every unique pipeline. By default, atom starts with one branch called \"master\". To start a new branch, set a new name to the property, e.g. atom . branch = \"undersample\" . This creates a new branch from the current one. To create a branch from any other branch type \"_from_\" between the new name and the branch from which to split, e.g. atom . branch = \"oversample_from_master\" creates branch \"oversample\" from branch \"master\", even if the current branch is \"undersample\". To switch between existing branches, just type the name of the desired branch, e.g. atom . branch = \"master\" brings you back to the master branch. Note that every branch contains a unique copy of the whole dataset! Creating many branches can cause memory issues for large datasets. See the Imbalanced datasets or Feature engineering examples for branching use cases. Warning Always create a new branch if you want to change the dataset after fitting a model! Figure 1. Diagram of a possible branch system to compare an oversampling with an undersampling pipeline. Memory considerations An atom instance stores one copy of the dataframe in each branch, and one copy of the initial dataset with which the instance is initialized (this copy is necessary to avoid data leakage during hyperparameter tuning and for some specific methods like cross_validate and reset ). This initial copy is created as soon as there are no branches in the initial state (usually after calling the first data transformation) and it's stored in an internal branch called og (original). The og branch is not accessible by the user. If the dataset is occupying too much memory, consider using the shrink method to convert the dtypes to their smallest possible matching dtype. Apart from the dataset itself, a model's prediction attributes (e.g. atom . lr . predict_train ), metric scores and shap values are also stored as attributes of the model to avoid having to recalculate them every time they are needed. This data can occupy a considerable amount of memory for large datasets. You can delete all these attributes using the clear method in order to free some memory before saving the class. Data transformations Performing data transformations is a common requirement of many datasets before they are ready to be ingested by a model. ATOM provides various classes to apply data cleaning and feature engineering transformations to the data. This tooling should be able to help you apply most of the typically needed transformations to get the data ready for modelling. For further fine-tuning, it's also possible to transform the data using custom transformers (see the add method) or through a function (see the apply method). Remember that all transformations are only applied to the dataset in the current branch.", "title": "Data management"}, {"location": "user_guide/data_management/#data-management", "text": "", "title": "Data management"}, {"location": "user_guide/data_management/#data-sets", "text": "ATOM is designed to work around one single dataset: the one with which atom is initialized.

For example, on one pipeline with an undersampling strategy and the other with an oversampling strategy. To be able to do this, ATOM has the branching system. The branching system helps the user to manage multiple data pipelines within the same atom instance. Branches are created and accessed through atom's branch property. A branch contains a specific pipeline, the dataset transformed through that pipeline, and all data and utility attributes that refer to that dataset. Transformers and models called from atom use the dataset in the current branch, as well as data attributes such as atom.dataset . Use the branch's __repr__ to get an overview of the transformers in the branch. It's not allowed to change the data in a branch after fitting a model with it. Doing this would cause unexpected model behaviour and break down the plotting methods. Instead, create a new branch for every unique pipeline. By default, atom starts with one branch called \"master\". To start a new branch, set a new name to the property, e.g. atom . branch = \"undersample\" . This creates a new branch from the current one. To create a branch from any other branch type \"_from_\" between the new name and the branch from which to split, e.g. atom . branch = \"oversample_from_master\" creates branch \"oversample\" from branch \"master\", even if the current branch is \"undersample\". To switch between existing branches, just type the name of the desired branch, e.g. atom . branch = \"master\" brings you back to the master branch. Note that every branch contains a unique copy of the whole dataset! Creating many branches can cause memory issues for large datasets. See the Imbalanced datasets or Feature engineering examples for branching use cases. Warning Always create a new branch if you want to change the dataset after fitting a model! Figure 1.

This initial copy is created as soon as there are no branches in the initial state (usually after calling the first data transformation) and it's stored in an internal branch called og (original). The og branch is not accessible by the user. If the dataset is occupying too much memory, consider using the shrink method to convert the dtypes to their smallest possible matching dtype. Apart from the dataset itself, a model's prediction attributes (e.g. atom . lr . predict_train ), metric scores and shap values are also stored as attributes of the model to avoid having to recalculate them every time they are needed.

Remember that all transformations are only applied to the dataset in the current branch.", "title": "Data transformations"}, {"location": "user_guide/feature_engineering/", "text": "Feature engineering Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from the existing ones, in order to capture relationships with the target column that the first set of features didn't have on their own. This process is very important to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Although feature engineering works best when the data scientist applies use-case specific transformations, there are ways to do this in an automated manner, without prior domain knowledge. One of the problems of creating new features without human expert intervention, is that many of the newly created features can be useless, i.e. they do not help the algorithm to make better predictions. Even worse, having useless features can drop your performance. To avoid this, we perform feature selection, a process in which we select the relevant features in the dataset. See the Feature engineering example. Note All of atom's feature engineering methods automatically adopt the relevant transformer attributes ( n_jobs , verbose , logger , random_state ) from atom. A different choice can be added as parameter to the method call, e.g. atom . feature_selection ( \"pca\" , n_features = 10 , random_state = 2 ) . Note Like the add method, the feature engineering methods accept the columns parameter to only transform a subset of the dataset's features, e.g. atom . feature_selection ( \"pca\" , n_features = 10 , columns = slice ( 5 , 15 )) . Extracting datetime features Features that contain dates or timestamps can not be directly ingested by models since they are not strictly numerical. Encoding them as categorical features is not an option since the encoding does not capture the relationship between the different moments in time. The FeatureExtractor class creates new features extracting datetime elements (e.g. day, month, year, hour...) from the columns. It can be accessed from atom through the feature_extraction method. The new features are named equally to the column from which they are extracted, followed by an underscore and the datetime element they create, e.g. x0_day for the day element of x0 . Note that many time features have a cyclic pattern, e.g. after Sunday comes Monday. This means that if we would encode the days of the week from 0 to 6, we would lose that relation. A common method used to encode cyclical features is to transform the data into two dimensions using a sine and cosine transformation: \\[ x_{sin} = sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi * x}{max(x)}\\right) \\] \\[ x_{cos} = cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi * x}{max(x)}\\right) \\] The resulting features have their names followed by sin or cos, e.g. x0_day_sin and x0_day_cos . The datetime elements that can be encoded in a cyclic fashion are: microsecond, second, minute, hour, weekday, day, day_of_year, month and quarter. Note that decision trees based algorithms build their split rules according to one feature at a time. This means that they will fail to correctly process cyclic features since the sin/cos values are expected to be considered as one single coordinate system. Use the fmt parameter to specify your feature's format in case the column is categorical. The FeatureExtractor class will convert the column to the datetime dtype before extracting the specified features. Click here for an overview of the available formats. Generating new features The FeatureGenerator class creates new non-linear features based on the original feature set. It can be accessed from atom through the feature_generation method. You can choose between two strategies: Deep Feature Synthesis and Genetic Feature Generation. Deep Feature Synthesis Deep feature synthesis (DFS) applies the selected operators on the features in the dataset. For example, if the operator is \"log\", it will create the new feature LOG(old_feature) and if the operator is \"mul\", it will create the new feature old_feature_1 x old_feature_2 . The operators can be chosen through the operators parameter. Choose from: add : Take the sum of two features. sub: Subtract two features from each other. mul: Multiply two features with each other. div: Divide two features with each other. abs: Calculate the absolute value of a feature. srqt: Calculate the square root of a feature. log: Calculate the natural logarithm of a feature. sin: Calculate the sine of a feature. cos: Calculate the cosine of a feature. tan: Calculate the tangent of a feature. ATOM's implementation of DFS uses the featuretools package. Genetic Feature Generation Genetic feature generation (GFG) uses genetic programming , a branch of evolutionary programming, to determine which features are successful and create new ones based on those. Where dfs can be seen as some kind of \"brute force\" for feature engineering, gfg tries to improve its features with every generation of the algorithm. gfg uses the same operators as dfs, but instead of only applying the transformations once, it evolves them further, creating nested structures of combinations of features. The new features are given the name feature_n , where n stands for the n-th feature in the dataset. You can access the genetic feature's fitness and description (how they are calculated) through the genetic_features attribute. ATOM uses the SymbolicTransformer class from the gplearn package for the genetic algorithm. Read more about this implementation here . Grouping similar features When your dataset contains many similar features corresponding to a certain natural group or entity, it's possible to replace these features for a handful of them, that should capture the relations of the group, in order to lose as little information as possible. To achieve this, the FeatureGrouper class computes certain statistical properties that describe the group's distribution, like the mean or the median, and replaces the columns with the result of these statistical calculations over every row in the dataset. The goal of this approach is to reduce the number of columns in the dataset, avoiding the curse of dimensionality . Selecting useful features The FeatureSelector class provides tooling to select the relevant features from a dataset. It can be accessed from atom through the feature_selection method. Standard strategies Univariate Univariate feature selection works by selecting the best features based on univariate statistical F-test. The test is provided via the solver parameter. It takes any function taking two arrays (X, y), and returning arrays (scores, p-values). Read more in sklearn's documentation . Principal Components Analysis Applying PCA reduces the dimensionality of the dataset by maximizing the variance of each dimension. The new features are called pca0 , pca1 , etc... PCA can be applied in three ways: If the data is dense (i.e. not sparse), the estimator used is PCA . Before fitting the transformer, the data is scaled to mean=0 and std=1 if it wasn't already. Read more in sklearn's documentation . If the data is [sparse][sparse datasets] (often the case for term-document matrices, see Vectorizer ), the estimator used is TruncatedSVD . Read more in sklearn's documentation . If engine is \"sklearnex\" or \"cuml\", the estimator used is the package's PCA implementation. Sparse data is not supported for neither engine. Selection from model SFM uses an estimator with feature_importances_ or coef_ attributes to select the best features in a dataset based on importance weights. The estimator is provided through the solver parameter and can be already fitted. ATOM allows you to use one its predefined models , e.g. solver = \"RF\" . If you didn't call the FeatureSelector through atom, don't forget to indicate the estimator's task adding _class or _reg after the name, e.g. RF_class to use a random forest classifier. Read more in sklearn's documentation . Sequential Feature Selection Sequential feature selection adds (forward selection) or removes (backward selection) features to form a feature subset in a greedy fashion. At each stage, this estimator chooses the best feature to add or remove based on the cross-validation score of an estimator. Read more in sklearn's documentation . Recursive Feature Elimination Select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features, and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a coef_ or through a feature_importances_ attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features. That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached. Note that, since RFE needs to fit the model again every iteration, this method can be fairly slow. RFECV applies the same algorithm as RFE but uses a cross-validated metric (under the scoring parameter, see RFECV ) to assess every step's performance. Also, where RFE returns the number of features selected by n_features , RFECV returns the number of features that achieved the optimal score on the specified metric. Note that this is not always equal to the amount specified by n_features . Read more in sklearn's documentation . Advanced strategies The following strategies are a collection of nature-inspired optimization algorithms that maximize an objective function. If not manually specified, the function calculates the cross-validated score of a model on the data. Use the scoring parameter (not present in description, part of kwargs) to specify the metric to optimize on. Particle Swarm Optimization Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizes a problem by having a population of candidate solutions (particles), and moving them around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formula over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. Read more here . Harris Hawks Optimization Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) mimics the action and reaction of Hawk's team collaboration hunting in nature and prey escaping to discover the solutions of the single-objective problem. Read more here . Grey Wolf Optimization The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. Four types of grey wolves such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega are employed for simulating the leadership hierarchy. In addition, three main steps of hunting, searching for prey, encircling prey, and attacking prey, are implemented to perform optimization. Read more here . Dragonfly Optimization The Dragonfly Algorithm (DFO) algorithm originates from static and dynamic swarming behaviours. These two swarming behaviours are very similar to the two main phases of optimization using meta-heuristics: exploration and exploitation. Dragonflies create sub swarms and fly over different areas in a static swarm, which is the main objective of the exploration phase. In the static swarm, however, dragonflies fly in bigger swarms and along one direction, which is favourable in the exploitation phase. Read more here . Genetic Optimization Genetic Optimization is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. Read more here . Other selection methods Removing features with low or high variance Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Features with low variance have many values repeated, which means the model can't learn much from them. In a similar way, features with very high variance have very few values repeated, which makes it also difficult for a model to learn from this feature. FeatureSelector removes a categorical feature when the maximum number of occurrences for any value is below min_repeated or when the same value is repeated in at least max_repeated fraction of the rows. The default option is to remove a feature if all values in it are either different or exactly the same. Removing features with multi-collinearity Two features that are highly correlated are redundant, i.e. two will not contribute more to the model than only one of them. FeatureSelector will drop a feature that has a Pearson correlation coefficient larger than max_correlation with another feature. A correlation of 1 means the two columns are equal.

The logging file contains method calls, all printed messages to stdout with maximum verbosity, and any exception raised during running. Tracking ATOM uses mlflow tracking as a backend API and UI for logging the models in its pipeline. Start tracking your experiments assigning a name to the experiment parameter. Every model is tracked using a separate run. When no backend is configured, the data is stored locally at ./mlruns . To configure the backend, use mlflow.set_tracking_uri in your notebook or IDE before initializing atom.

After fitting, a class containing the underlying estimator is attached to atom as an attribute. We refer to these \"subclasses\" as models. Apart from the estimator, the models contain a variety of attributes and methods that can help you understand how the underlying estimator performed. They can be accessed using their acronyms, e.g. atom.LGB to access the LightGBM model. The available models and their corresponding acronyms are: \"AdaB\" for AdaBoost \"ARD\" for AutomaticRelevanceDetermination \"Bag\" for Bagging \"BR\" for BayesianRidge \"BNB\" for BernoulliNB \"CatB\" for CatBoost \"CatNB\" for CategoricalNB \"CNB\" for ComplementNB \"Tree\" for DecisionTree \"Dummy\" for Dummy \"EN\" for ElasticNet \"ETree\" for ExtraTree \"ET\" for ExtraTrees \"GNB\" for GaussianNB \"GP\" for GaussianProcess \"GBM\" for GradientBoosting \"Huber\" for HuberRegression \"hGBM\" for HistGradientBoosting \"KNN\" for KNearestNeighbors \"Lasso\" for Lasso \"Lars\" for LeastAngleRegression \"LGB\" for LightGBM \"LDA\" for LinearDiscriminantAnalysis \"lSVM\" for LinearSVM \"LR\" for LogisticRegression \"MLP\" for MultiLayerPerceptron \"MNB\" for MultinomialNB \"OLS\" for OrdinaryLeastSquares \"OMP\" for OrthogonalMatchingPursuit \"PA\" for PassiveAggressive \"Perc\" for Perceptron \"QDA\" for QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis \"RNN\" for RadiusNearestNeighbors \"RF\" for RandomForest \"Ridge\" for Ridge \"SGD\" for StochasticGradientDescent \"SVM\" for SupportVectorMachine \"XGB\" for XGBoost Warning The model classes can not be initialized directly by the user! Use them only through atom. Tip The acronyms are case-insensitive, e.g. atom.lgb also calls the LightGBM model. Custom models It is also possible to create your own models in ATOM's pipeline. For example, imagine we want to use sklearn's RANSACRegressor estimator (note that is not included in ATOM's predefined models ). There are two ways to achieve this: Using ATOMModel (recommended). With this approach you can pass the required model characteristics to the pipeline. >>> from atom import ATOMRegressor , ATOMModel >>> from sklearn.linear_model import RANSACRegressor >>> ransac = ATOMModel ( ... models = RANSACRegressor , ... acronym = \"RANSAC\" , ... fullname = \"Random Sample Consensus\" , ... needs_scaling = True , ... ) >>> atom = ATOMRegressor ( X , y ) >>> atom . run ( ransac ) Using the estimator's class or an instance of the class. This approach will also call ATOMModel under the hood, but it will leave its parameters to their default values. >>> from atom import ATOMRegressor >>> from sklearn.linear_model import RANSACRegressor >>> atom = ATOMRegressor ( X , y ) >>> atom . run ( RANSACRegressor ) Additional things to take into account: Custom models can be accessed through their acronym like any other model, e.g. atom.ransac in the example above. Custom models are not restricted to sklearn estimators, but they should follow sklearn's API , i.e. have a fit and predict method. Parameter customization (for the initializer) is only possible for custom models which provide an estimator that has a set_params() method, i.e. it's a child class of BaseEstimator . Hyperparameter tuning for custom models is ignored unless appropriate dimensions are provided through ht_params . Deep learning Deep learning models can be used through ATOM's custom models as long as they follow sklearn's API . For example, models implemented with the Keras package should use the scikeras wrappers KerasClassifier or KerasRegressor . Many deep learning use cases, for example in computer vision, use datasets with more than 2 dimensions, e.g. image data can have shape (n_samples, length, width, rgb). Luckily, scikeras has a workaround to be able to work with such datasets. Learn with this example how to use ATOM to train and validate a Convolutional Neural Network on an image dataset. Warning Models implemented with keras can only use custom hyperparameter tuning when n_jobs = 1 or ht_params = { \"cv\" : 1 } . Using n_jobs > 1 and cv > 1 raises a PicklingError due to incompatibilities of the APIs. Ensembles Ensemble models use multiple estimators to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. ATOM implements two ensemble techniques: voting and stacking. Click here to see an example that uses ensemble models. If the ensemble's underlying estimator is a model that used automated feature scaling , it's added as a Pipeline containing the scaler and estimator. If a mlflow experiment is active, the ensembles start their own run, just like the predefined models do. Warning Combining models trained on different branches into one ensemble is not allowed and will raise an exception. Voting The idea behind voting is to combine the predictions of conceptually different models to make new predictions. Such a technique can be useful for a set of equally well performing models in order to balance out their individual weaknesses. Read more in sklearn's documentation . A voting model is created from a trainer through the voting method. The voting model is added automatically to the list of models in the trainer, under the Vote acronym. The underlying estimator is a custom adaptation of VotingClassifier or VotingRegressor depending on the task. The differences between ATOM's and sklearn's implementation are: ATOM's implementation doesn't fit estimators if they're already fitted. ATOM's instance is considered fitted at initialization when all underlying estimators are. ATOM's VotingClassifier doesn't implement a LabelEncoder to encode the target column. The two estimators are customized in this way to save time and computational resources, since the classes are always initialized with fitted estimators. As a consequence of this, the VotingClassifier can not use sklearn's build-in LabelEncoder for the target column since it can't be fitted when initializing the class. For the vast majority of use cases, the changes will have no effect. If you want to export the estimator and retrain it on different data, just make sure to clone the underlying estimators first. Stacking Stacking is a method for combining estimators to reduce their biases. More precisely, the predictions of each individual estimator are stacked together and used as input to a final estimator to compute the prediction. Read more in sklearn's documentation . A stacking model is created from a trainer through the stacking method. The stacking model is added automatically to the list of models in the trainer, under the Stack acronym.

The nlp module contains four classes that help to convert raw text to meaningful numeric values, ready to be ingested by a model. ATOM uses the nltk library for the majority of its NLP processes. The text documents are expected to be provided in a column of the dataframe named corpus (the name is case-insensitive). Only the corpus is changed by the transformers, leaving the rest of the columns as is. This mechanism allows atom to combine datasets containing a text corpus with other non-text features. If an array is provided as input, it should consist of only one feature containing the text (one document per row). ATOM will then automatically convert the array to a dataframe with the desired column name. Documents are expected to be strings or sequences of words. Click here for an example using text data. Note All of atom's NLP methods automatically adopt the relevant transformer attributes ( verbose , logger ) from atom. A different choice can be added as parameter to the method call, e.g. atom . tokenize ( verbose = 0 ) . Info ATOM doesn't do topic modelling! The module's goal is to help process text documents into features that can be used for supervised learning. Text cleaning Text data is rarely clean. Whether it's scraped from a website or inferred from paper documents, it's always populated with irrelevant information for the model, such as email addresses, HTML tags, numbers or punctuation marks. Use the TextCleaner class to clean the corpus from such noise. It can be accessed from atom through the textclean method. Use the class' parameters to choose which transformations to perform. The available steps are: Decode unicode characters to their ascii representations. Convert all characters to lower case. Drop email addresses from the text. Drop URL links from the text. Drop HTML tags from the text. Drop emojis from the text. Drop numbers from the text. Drop punctuations from the text. Tokenization Some text processing algorithms, like stemming or lemmatization, require the corpus to be made out of tokens, instead of strings, in order to know what to consider as words. Tokenization is used to achieve this. It separates every document into a sequence of smaller units. In this case, the words. Sometimes, words have a different meaning on their own than when combined with adjacent words. For example, the word new has a completely different meaning when the word york is directly after it than when it's not. These combinations of two words are called bigrams. When there are three words, they are called trigrams, and with four words quadgrams. The Tokenizer class converts a document into a sequence of words, and can create the most frequent bigrams, trigrams and quadgrams. It can be accessed from atom through the tokenize method. Text Normalization Normalization for texts is a process that converts a list of words to a more uniform standard. This is useful to reduce the amount of different information that the computer has to deal with, and therefore improves efficiency. The goal of normalization techniques like stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inflectional and related forms of a word to a common base form. Normalize the words in the corpus using the TextNormalizer class. It can be accessed from atom through the textnormalize method. Vectorization Text data cannot be fed directly to the algorithms themselves, as most of them expect numerical feature vectors with a fixed size, rather than words in the text documents with variable length. Vectorization is the general process of turning a collection of text documents into numerical feature vectors. You can apply it to the corpus using the Vectorizer class. It can be accessed from atom through the vectorize method. Info All strategies can utilize GPU speed-up. Click here for further information about GPU acceleration.

Descriptions and examples can be found in the API section. ATOM mainly uses the plotly library for plotting. Plotly makes interactive, publication-quality graphs that are rendered using html. Some plots require other libraries like matplotlib , shap , wordcloud and schemdraw . Plots that compare model performances (methods with the models parameter) can be called directly from atom, e.g. atom . plot_roc () , or from one of the models, e.g. atom . adab . plot_roc () . If called from atom, use the models parameter to specify which models to plot. If called from a specific model, it makes the plot only for that model and the models parameter becomes unavailable. Plots that analyze the data (methods without the models parameter) can only be called from atom, and not from the models. Parameters Apart from the plot-specific parameters, all plots have five parameters in common: The title parameter adds a title to the plot. The default value doesn't show any title. Provide a configuration (as dictionary) to customize its appearance, e.g. title = dict ( text = \"Awesome plot\" , color = \"red\" ) . Read more in plotly's documentation . The legend parameter is used to show/hide, position or customize the plot's legend. Provide a configuration (as dictionary) to customize its appearance (e.g. legend = dict ( title = \"Title for legend\" , title_font_color = \"red\" ) ) or choose one of the following locations: upper left upper right lower left lower right upper center lower center center left center right center out: Position the legend outside the axis, on the right hand side. This is plotly's default position. Note that this shrinks the size of the axis to fit both legend and axes in the specified figsize . The figsize parameter adjust the plot's size. The filename parameter is used to save the plot. The display parameter determines whether to show or return the plot. Aesthetics The plot's aesthetics can be customized using the plot attributes, e.g. atom . title_fontsize = 30 . The default values are: palette: [\"rgb(0, 98, 98)\", \"rgb(56, 166, 165)\", \"rgb(115, 175, 72)\", \"rgb(237, 173, 8)\", \"rgb(225, 124, 5)\", \"rgb(204, 80, 62)\", \"rgb(148, 52, 110)\", \"rgb(111, 64, 112)\", \"rgb(102, 102, 102)\"] title_fontsize: 24 label_fontsize: 16 tick_fontsize: 12 Use atom's update_layout method to further customize the plot's aesthetics using any of plotly's layout properties , e.g. atom . update_layout ( template = \"plotly_dark\" ) . Use the reset_aesthetics method to reset the aesthetics to their default value. See advanced plotting for various examples. Canvas Use the canvas method to draw multiple plots side by side, for example to make it easier to compare similar results. The canvas method is a @contextmanager , i.e. it's used through Python's with command. Plots in a canvas ignore the legend, figsize, filename and display parameters. Instead, specify these parameters in the canvas. If a variable is assigned to the canvas (e.g. with atom . canvas () as fig ), it yields the resulting figure. For example, we can use a canvas to compare the results of a XGBoost and LightGBM model on the train and test set. We could also draw the lines for both models in the same axes, but that would clutter the plot too much.

It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. ATOM implements methods to plot 7 of SHAP's plotting functions directly from its API. A list of available shap plots can be found here . Calculating the Shapley values is computationally expensive, especially for model agnostic explainers like Permutation . To avoid having to recalculate the values for every plot, ATOM stores the shapley values internally after the first calculation, and access them later when needed again. Note Since the plot figures are not made by ATOM, note the following: It's not possible to draw multiple models in the same figure. Selecting more than one model will raise an exception. To avoid this, call the plot directly from a model, e.g. atom . lr . plot_shap_force () . The returned plot is a matplotlib figure, not plotly's.

Just like a sklearn estimator, you can call the prediction methods from the model, e.g. atom.tree.predict(X) . All prediction methods transform the provided data through the pipeline in the model's branch before making the predictions. Transformers that should only be applied on the training set are excluded from this step (e.g. outlier pruning or class balancing). The available prediction methods are the most common methods for estimators in sklearn's API: decision_function Get confidence scores on new data or rows in the dataset. predict Get class predictions on new data or rows in the dataset. predict_log_proba Get class log-probabilities on new data or rows in the dataset. predict_proba Get class probabilities on new data or rows in the dataset. score Get a metric score on new data.

After this, you can use the plots and prediction methods to evaluate the results. The training applies the following steps for all models: Use hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal hyperparameters for the model (optional). The model is fitted on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. After that, the model is evaluated on the tes set. Calculate various scores on the test set using a bootstrap algorithm (optional). There are three approaches to run the training. Direct training: DirectClassifier DirectRegressor Training via successive halving : SuccessiveHalvingClassifier SuccessiveHalvingRegressor Training via train sizing : TrainSizingClassifier TrainSizingRegressor The direct fashion repeats the aforementioned steps only once, while the other two approaches repeats them more than once. Just like the data cleaning and feature engineering classes, it's discouraged to use these classes directly. Instead, every approach can be called directly from atom through the run , successive_halving and train_sizing methods respectively. Models are called through their acronyms , e.g. atom . run ( models = \"RF\" ) will train a RandomForest . If you want to run the same model multiple times, add a tag after the acronym to differentiate them. >>> atom . run ( ... models = [ \"RF1\" , \"RF2\" ], ... est_params = { ... \"RF1\" : { \"n_estimators\" : 100 }, ... \"RF2\" : { \"n_estimators\" : 200 }, ... } ... ) For example, this pipeline fits two Random Forest models, one with 100 and the other with 200 decision trees. The models can be accessed through atom.rf1 and atom.rf2 . Use tagged models to test how the same model performs when fitted with different parameters or on different data sets. See the Imbalanced datasets example. Additional things to take into account: If an exception is encountered while fitting an estimator, the pipeline will automatically jump to the next model. The exceptions are stored in the errors attribute. Note that when a model is skipped, there is no model subclass for that estimator. When showing the final results, a ! indicates the highest score and a ~ indicates that the model is possibly overfitting (training set has a score at least 20% higher than the test set). Metric ATOM uses sklearn's scorers for model evaluation. A scorer consists of a metric function and some parameters that define the scorer's properties , such as if a higher or lower score is better (score or loss function) or if the function needs probability estimates or rounded predictions (see the make_scorer function). The metric parameter accepts three ways of defining the scorer: Using the name of one of the predefined scorers . Using a function with signature function ( y_true , y_pred ) -> score . In this case, ATOM uses make_scorer with default parameters. Using a scorer object. Note that all scorers follow the convention that higher return values are better than lower return values. Thus, metrics which measure the distance between the model and the data (i.e. loss functions), like max_error or mean_squared_error , will return the negated value of the metric. Predefined scorers ATOM accepts all sklearn's scorers as well as some custom acronyms and custom scorers. Since some of sklearn's scorers have quite long names and ATOM is all about lazy fast experimentation, the package provides acronyms for some of the most commonly used ones. These acronyms are case-insensitive and can be used in the metric parameter instead of the scorer's full name, e.g. atom . run ( \"LR\" , metric = \"BA\" ) uses balanced_accuracy . The available acronyms are: \"AP\" for \"average_precision\" \"BA\" for \"balanced_accuracy\" \"AUC\" for \"roc_auc\" \"LogLoss\" for \"neg_log_loss\" \"EV\" for \"explained_variance\" \"ME\" for \"max_error\" \"MAE\" for \"neg_mean_absolute_error\" \"MSE\" for \"neg_mean_squared_error\" \"RMSE\" for \"neg_root_mean_squared_error\" \"MSLE\" for \"neg_mean_squared_log_error\" \"MEDAE\" for \"neg_median_absolute_error\" \"MAPE\" for \"neg_mean_absolute_percentage_error\" \"POISSON\" for \"neg_mean_poisson_deviance\" \"GAMMA\" for \"neg_mean_gamma_deviance\" ATOM also provides some extra common metrics for binary classification tasks. \"TN\" for True Negatives \"FP\" for False Positives \"FN\" for False Negatives \"TP\" for True Positives \"FPR\" for False Positive rate (fall-out) \"TPR\" for True Positive Rate (sensitivity, recall) \"TNR\" for True Negative Rate (specificity) \"FNR\" for False Negative Rate (miss rate) \"MCC\" for Matthews Correlation Coefficient (also for multiclass classification) Multi-metric runs Sometimes it is useful to measure the performance of the models in more than one way. ATOM lets you run the pipeline with multiple metrics at the same time. To do so, provide the metric parameter with a list of desired metrics, e.g. atom . run ( \"LDA\" , metric = [ \"r2\" , \"mse\" ]) . When fitting multi-metric runs, the resulting scores will return a list of metrics. For example, if you provided three metrics to the pipeline, atom . knn . score_train could return [0.8734, 0.6672, 0.9001]. Only the first metric of a multi-metric run (this metric is called the main metric) is used to select the winning model. Info The winning model is retrieved comparing only the main metric. Some plots let you choose which of the metrics in a multi-metric run to show using the metric parameter, e.g. plot_results . Automated feature scaling Models that require feature scaling will automatically do so before training, unless the data is sparse or already scaled. The data is considered scaled if it has one of the following prerequisites: The mean value over the mean of all columns lies between -0.05 and 0.05 and the mean of the standard deviation over all columns lies between 0.85 and 1.15. Categorical and binary columns (only 0s and 1s) are excluded from the calculation. There is a transformer in the pipeline whose __name__ contains the word scaler . The scaling is applied using a Scaler with default parameters. It can be accessed from the model through the scaler attribute. The scaled dataset can be examined through the model's data attributes . Use the available_models method to see which models require feature scaling. See here an example. In-training validation Some predefined models allow in-training validation. This means that the estimator is evaluated (using only the main metric ) on the train and test set after every round of the training (a round can be an iteration for linear models or an added tree for boosted tree models). The validation scores are stored in the evals attribute, a dictionary of the train and test performances per round (also when pruning isn't applied). Click here for an example using in-training validation. The predefined models that support in-training validation are: CatBoost LightGBM MultiLayerPerceptron PassiveAggressive Perceptron StochasticGradientDescent XGBoost To apply in-training validation to a custom model , use the has_validation parameter when creating the custom model. Warning In-training validation is not calculated during hyperparameter tuning . Tip Use the plot_evals method to visualize the in-training validation on the train and test sets. Parameter customization By default, every estimator uses the default parameters they get from their respective packages. To select different ones, use the est_params . parameter of the run method. There are two ways to add custom parameters to the models: adding them directly to the dictionary as key-value pairs or through dictionaries. Adding the parameters directly to est_params (or using a dict with the key 'all') shares them across all models in the trainer. In this example, both the XGBoost and the LightGBM model use 200 boosted trees. Make sure all the models do have the specified parameters or an exception will be raised! >>> atom . run ( models = [ \"XGB\" , \"LGB\" ], est_params = { \"n_estimators\" : 200 }) To specify parameters per model, use the model name as key and a dict of the parameters as value. In this example, the XGBoost model uses n_estimators=200 and the MultiLayerPerceptron uses one hidden layer with 75 neurons. >>> atom . run ( ... models = [ \"XGB\" , \"MLP\" ], ... est_params = { ... \"XGB\" : { \"n_estimators\" : 200 }, ... \"MLP\" : { \"hidden_layer_sizes\" : ( 75 ,)}, ... } ... ) Some estimators allow you to pass extra parameters to the fit method (besides X and y). This can be done adding _fit at the end of the parameter. For example, to change XGBoost 's verbosity, we can run: >>> atom . run ( models = \"XGB\" , est_params = { \"verbose_fit\" : True }) Note If a parameter is specified through est_params , it's ignored by the study, even if it's added manually to ht_params [ \"distributions\" ] . Info The estimator's n_jobs and random_state parameters adopt atom's values (when available), unless specified through est_params . Hyperparameter tuning In order to achieve maximum performance, it's important to tune an estimator's hyperparameters before training it. ATOM provides hyperparameter tuning through the optuna package. Just like optuna, we use the terms study and trial as follows: Study: optimization based on an objective function. Trial: a single execution of the objective function. Each trial is either computed by cross-validation on the complete training set or by randomly splitting the training set every iteration into a (sub)training and validation set. This process can create some minimum data leakage towards specific parameters (since the estimator is evaluated on data that is used to train the next estimator), but it ensures maximal use of the provided data. However, the leakage is not present in the independent test set, thus the final score of every model is unbiased. Note that, if the dataset is relatively small, the tuning's best score can consistently be lower than the final score on the test set due to the considerable lower fraction of instances on which it is trained. After finishing the study, the parameters that resulted in the best score are used to fit the final model on the complete training set. Info Unless specified differently by the user, the used samplers are TPESampler for single-metric runs and NSGAIISampler for multi-metric runs . For multi-metric runs , the selected best trial is the trial that performed best on the main metric. Use the property's @setter to change it to any other trial. See the hyperparameter tuning example. There are many possibilities to tune the study to your liking. The main parameter is n_trials , which determine the number of trials that are performed. Extra things to take into account: The train/validation splits are different per trial but equal for all models. Re-evaluating the objective function at the same point (with the same hyperparameters) automatically skips the calculation and returns the same score as the equivalent trial. Tip The hyperparameter tuning output can become quite wide for models with many hyperparameters. If you are working in a Jupyter Notebook, you can change the output's width running the following code in a cell: >>> from IPython.display import display , HTML >>> display ( HTML ( \"<style>.container { width:100% !important; }</style>\" )) Other settings can be changed through the ht_params parameter, a dictionary where every key-value combination can be used to further customize the optimization. By default, which hyperparameters are tuned and their corresponding distributions are predefined by ATOM. Use the 'distributions' key to customize these. Just like with est_params , it's possible to share the same parameters across models or use a dictionary with the model name as key to specify the parameters for every individual model. Use the key 'all' to tune some hyperparameters for all models when you also want to tune other parameters only for specific ones. The following example tunes the n_estimators parameter for both models but the max_depth parameter only for the RandomForest . >>> atom . run ( ... models = [ \"ET\" , \"RF\" ], ... n_trials = 30 , ... ht_params = { \"distributions\" : { \"all\" : \"n_estimators\" , \"RF\" : \"max_depth\" }}, ... ) Like the columns parameter in atom's methods, you can exclude parameters from the optimization adding ! before its name. It's possible to exclude multiple parameters, but not to combine inclusion and exclusion for the same model. For example, to optimize a RandomForest using all its predefined parameters except n_estimators , run: >>> atom . run ( ... models = \"ET\" , ... n_trials = 15 , ... ht_params = { \"distributions\" : \"!n_estimators\" }, ... ) If just the parameter name is provided, the predefined distribution is used. It's also possible to provide custom distributions spaces, but make sure they are compliant with optuna's API . See every model's individual documentation in ATOM's API section for an overview of their hyperparameters and distributions. >>> from optuna.distributions import ( ... IntDistribution , FloatDistribution , CategoricalDistribution ... ) >>> atom . run ( ... models = [ \"ET\" , \"RF\" ], ... n_trials = 30 , ... ht_params = { ... \"dimensions\" : { ... \"all\" : { \"n_estimators\" : IntDistribution ( 10 , 100 , step = 10 ), ... \"RF\" : { ... \"max_depth\" : IntDistribution ( 1 , 10 ), ... \"max_features\" : CategoricalDistribution ([ \"sqrt\" , \"log2\" ]), ... }, ... }, ... }, ... ) Parameters for optuna's study and the study's optimize method can be added as kwargs to ht_params . For example, to use a different sampler or add a custom callback. >>> from optuna.samplers import RandomSampler >>> atom . run ( ... models = \"LR\" , ... n_trials = 30 , ... ht_params = { ... \"sampler\" : RandomSampler ( seed = atom . random_state ), ... \"callbacks\" : custom_callback (), ... }, ... ) Note If you use the default sampler, it\u2019s recommended to consider setting larger n_trials to make full use of the characteristics of TPESampler because TPESampler uses some (by default, 10) trials for its startup. When specifying distributions manually, make sure to import the distribution types from optuna: from optuna.distributions import ... . Warning Keras' models can only use hyperparameter tuning when n_jobs = 1 or ht_params = { \"cv\" : 1 } . Using n_jobs > 1 and cv > 1 raises a PicklingError due to incompatibilities of the APIs. Read here more about deep learning models. Tip ATOM has several plots that can help you examine a model's study and trials. Have a look at them here . Pruning During hyperparameter tuning, pruning stops unpromising trials at the early stages of the training (a.k.a., automated early-stopping). This can save the pipeline much time that would otherwise be wasted on an estimator that is unlikely to yield the best results. A pruned trial can't be selected as best_trial . Click here to see an example that uses pruning. The study uses MedianPruner as default pruner. You can use any other of optuna's pruners through the ht_params parameter. >>> from optuna.pruners import HyperbandPruner >>> atom . run ( \"SGD\" , n_trials = 30 , ht_params = { \"pruner\" : HyperbandPruner ()}) Warning Pruning is disabled for multi-metric runs . Pruning is only available for models that support in-training validation . Bootstrapping After fitting the estimator, you can assess the robustness of the model using the bootstrap technique. This technique creates several new data sets selecting random samples from the training set (with replacement) and evaluates them on the test set. This way you can get a distribution of the performance of the model. The sets are the same for every model. The number of sets can be chosen through the n_bootstrap parameter. Tip Use the plot_results method to plot the boostrap scores in a boxplot. Successive halving Successive halving is a bandit-based algorithm that fits N models to 1/N of the data. The best half are selected to go to the next iteration where the process is repeated. This continues until only one model remains, which is fitted on the complete dataset. Beware that a model's performance can depend greatly on the amount of data on which it is trained. For this reason, we recommend only to use this technique with similar models, e.g. only using tree-based models. Run successive halving from atom via the successive_halving method. Consecutive runs of the same model are saved with the model's acronym followed by the number of models in the run. For example, a RandomForest in a run with 4 models would become model RF4 . See here a successive halving example. Tip Use the plot_successive_halving method to see every model's performance per iteration of the successive halving. Train sizing When training models, there is usually a trade-off between model performance and computation time, that is regulated by the number of samples in the training set. Train sizing can be used to create insights in this trade-off, and help determine the optimal size of the training set. The models are fitted multiple times, ever-increasing the number of samples in the training set. Run train sizing from atom via the train_sizing method. The number of iterations and the number of samples per training can be specified with the train_sizes parameter. Consecutive runs of the same model are saved with the model's acronym followed by the fraction of rows in the training set (the . is removed from the fraction!). For example, a RandomForest in a run with 80% of the training samples would become model RF08 . See here a train sizing example. Tip Use the plot_learning_curve method to see the model's performance per size of the training set.", "title": "Training"}, {"location": "user_guide/training/#training", "text": "The training phase is where the models are fitted on the training data. After this, you can use the plots and prediction methods to evaluate the results. The training applies the following steps for all models: Use hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal hyperparameters for the model (optional). The model is fitted on the training set using the best combination of hyperparameters found. After that, the model is evaluated on the tes set. Calculate various scores on the test set using a bootstrap algorithm (optional). There are three approaches to run the training. Direct training: DirectClassifier DirectRegressor Training via successive halving : SuccessiveHalvingClassifier SuccessiveHalvingRegressor Training via train sizing : TrainSizingClassifier TrainSizingRegressor The direct fashion repeats the aforementioned steps only once, while the other two approaches repeats them more than once. Just like the data cleaning and feature engineering classes, it's discouraged to use these classes directly. Instead, every approach can be called directly from atom through the run , successive_halving and train_sizing methods respectively. Models are called through their acronyms , e.g. atom . run ( models = \"RF\" ) will train a RandomForest . If you want to run the same model multiple times, add a tag after the acronym to differentiate them. >>> atom . run ( ... models = [ \"RF1\" , \"RF2\" ], ... est_params = { ... \"RF1\" : { \"n_estimators\" : 100 }, ... \"RF2\" : { \"n_estimators\" : 200 }, ... } ... ) For example, this pipeline fits two Random Forest models, one with 100 and the other with 200 decision trees. The models can be accessed through atom.rf1 and atom.rf2 . Use tagged models to test how the same model performs when fitted with different parameters or on different data sets. See the Imbalanced datasets example. Additional things to take into account: If an exception is encountered while fitting an estimator, the pipeline will automatically jump to the next model. The exceptions are stored in the errors attribute. Note that when a model is skipped, there is no model subclass for that estimator. When showing the final results, a ! indicates the highest score and a ~ indicates that the model is possibly overfitting (training set has a score at least 20% higher than the test set).", "title": "Training"}, {"location": "user_guide/training/#metric", "text": "ATOM uses sklearn's scorers for model evaluation. A scorer consists of a metric function and some parameters that define the scorer's properties , such as if a higher or lower score is better (score or loss function) or if the function needs probability estimates or rounded predictions (see the make_scorer function). The metric parameter accepts three ways of defining the scorer: Using the name of one of the predefined scorers . Using a function with signature function ( y_true , y_pred ) -> score .

ATOM provides hyperparameter tuning through the optuna package. Just like optuna, we use the terms study and trial as follows: Study: optimization based on an objective function. Trial: a single execution of the objective function. Each trial is either computed by cross-validation on the complete training set or by randomly splitting the training set every iteration into a (sub)training and validation set. This process can create some minimum data leakage towards specific parameters (since the estimator is evaluated on data that is used to train the next estimator), but it ensures maximal use of the provided data. However, the leakage is not present in the independent test set, thus the final score of every model is unbiased. Note that, if the dataset is relatively small, the tuning's best score can consistently be lower than the final score on the test set due to the considerable lower fraction of instances on which it is trained. After finishing the study, the parameters that resulted in the best score are used to fit the final model on the complete training set.
